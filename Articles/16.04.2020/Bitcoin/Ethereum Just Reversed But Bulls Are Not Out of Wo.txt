Ethereum Price Nosedives

Yesterday, Ethereum made a couple of attempts to clear the $160 resistance area against the US Dollar. ETH price failed to gain bullish momentum above $160 and started a sharp decline.

There was a break below the key $155 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. More importantly, there was a break below a major contracting triangle with support near $155 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

The pair even traded below the $148 swing low and tested the main $145 support area (as discussed in the weekly analysis). A new weekly low is formed near $146 and the price is currently correcting higher.

Ethereum surpassed the $150 level to start a decent recovery. The bulls pushed the price above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $160 swing high to $146 swing low.

On the upside, there is a strong resistance forming near the $155 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average (the recent breakdown zone). The 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $160 swing high to $146 swing low is also near the $155 level.

To move back into a positive zone, the price must clear the $155 resistance and make another attempt to surpass the key $160 resistance in the coming sessions.

Bearish Scenario

On the downside, there is a decisive support forming near the $145 level. If the bulls fail to keep Ethereum price above the $145 support, there is a risk of a sharp decline.

The next support below $145 is near the $136 level, below which the price could even decline towards the $124 support level in the near term.
