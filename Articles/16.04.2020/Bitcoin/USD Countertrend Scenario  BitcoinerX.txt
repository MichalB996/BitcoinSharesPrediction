Bitcoin is still trending inside its falling channel on the 1-hour time frame and is currently testing support. A bounce off this area could take it back to the nearby resistance levels.

However, the 100 SMA is below the 200 SMA to indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside or that support is more likely to break than to hold. If that happens, bitcoin could make a steeper descent.

If support holds, on the other hand, bitcoin could recover to the mid-channel area of interest around $6,625 or the channel top closer to $6,900. This also lines up with the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point that adds to its strength as a ceiling.

Stochastic is heading higher to indicate that bullish momentum is returning while sellers take a break. The oscillator has plenty of room to climb before indicating overbought conditions, so buyers could stay in control for a bit longer. ADX is also returning above 50 to signal an ongoing trend.

Volume spiked recently on the recent drop to signal that market interest strengthened on a continuation of the trend. Subdued volume could keep the correction going while bears book profits.

It appears that bitcoin is still tracking risk assets these days as the altcoin is selling off while stocks and commodities took hits. Positive sentiment coming from the OPEC output deal and stimulus packages from governments seems to have faded, resulting in another wave lower for risk-taking.

Then again, long-term bulls could take this as an opportunity to buy on dips as market participants might be keen to position ahead of the halving of mining rewards in May. Recall that this event led to double the value of the coin over a few months, which could mean a lot of potential upside for bitcoin.
