Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc (TSXV: BEE) is one of this year’s Venture 50 companies — the company uses commercially-reared bees to deliver sustainable and effective crop control.

The company transitioned from development to a full-scale commercial enterprise and received regulatory approval from the EPA to sell products in the U.S.

The 2020 Venture 50 is a ranking of top performers on TSX Venture Exchange over the last year.
