TITLE: Bitcoin prices collapse during holiday season

There are some serious things I want to cover without ruining the holiday season.

The price of bitcoin collapsed down to around $6,700 a coin this week. Why? Because bitcoin and other digital currencies are a confidence game. And confidence in its value is eroding.

Also, Boston Federal Reserve head Eric Rosengren was yapping Tuesday after a speech to the Forecasters Club in New York, expressing concerns that the Fed’s interest rate cuts were causing high asset prices and excessive risk-taking.

Back in the late 1990s, people couldn’t understand why Fed head Alan Greenspan was so worried about inflation because they weren’t looking — as he was — at “asset inflation.” Then the stock market collapsed after the dot.com bubble and they understood.

I promise to dig deeper into these rich veins — after I lose the holiday spirit.
