Short term prediction: BULLISH

The cryptocurrency remains bullish, however, it is very close to becoming neutral. If it drops beneath the $9,000 level, we can consider the market as neutral. It would need to drop beneath $8,200 before we could consider it to be in danger of turning bearish.

Toward the downside, if the sellers break beneath $9,569 the next level of support lies at $9,311 (.5 Fib Retracement). Beneath this, support lies at $9,159 (downside 1.272 Fib Extension), $9,053 (.618 Fib Retracement), and $9,000.

On the other hand, if the buyers rebound here and push higher, resistance lies at $9,815 and $10,000. Above this, additional resistance lies at $10,190 (1.414 Fib Extension), $10,474 (1.618 Fib Extension) and $10,500.

The RSI dipped beneath the 50 level and remained there for the longest period during 2020. If the RSI is unable to climb back above 50 pretty soon, we can expect the moment to shift and for the bears to regain control.
