It has been a historic session across financial markets, due to the Saudi decision to start an oil price war with Russia, and the continued coronavirus crisis. The major U.S. indices plunged by the most since 2008, oil collapsed by over 20%, and the liquidations even reached the crypto segment, causing a sizable drop towards the end of the weekend and today. While we saw positive short-term signs ahead of the weekend the top coins all fell below their recent swing low, causing a wave of downgrades in the segment.

Our trend model is now once again bearish across the board with regards to the short-term time-frame, and it also switched negative case of several coins on the long-term time-frame./ the coming days will be crucial in deciding whether or not we witnessed a liquidation event or a major bearish shift, with all eyes on BTC and ETH, which are still holding on to their long-term buy signals.

BTC/USD, 4-Hour Chart Analysis

BTC failed to rally above $9,200 after forming a swing last week, and it started to lose ground Saturday in late trading, violating several key support levels including the swing low since then. The $8,200 support is at the center of attention, representing the low of the initial pullback following the January breakout. While the short-term outlook reversed there is still hope for bulls that the coin will hold on to its long-term buy signal should it quickly recover above $8,200.

BTC is back on a short-term sell signal in our trend model, while still being on a long-term buy signal with support now found near $7,800, $7,600, and near $7,350, and with resistance ahead near $8,200, $8,400, $8,600, and $9,200.

ETH/USD, 4-Hour Chart Analysis

Although ETH topped $250 on Saturday, it also got caught in the middle of the global liquidation event, falling more than 20% top-to-bottom, and dropping below the key $200 support in the process. While the second-largest coin is holding up above the $180-$185 zone, and thus to its long-term buy signal, the coming days will be crucial for the long-term outlook, as last week’s swing low was erased by the selloff.

ETH is also back on a short-term sell signal in our trend model, while still being on a long-term buy signal, with major support zones found between $180 and $185, and near $160 and $145, and with resistance zones ahead near $200, $230, and $260.

LTC Triggers Sell Signal As XRP Continues Lower

XRP/USD, 4-Hour Chart Analysis

XRP all but erased this year’s rally today, dipping below $0.20 and once again confirming its persistent relative weakness. The coin continues to be lag its closest peers and while a quick recovery could save XRP, today’s technical damage is significant and traders should stay away from entering positions here.

Our trend model is on sell signals on both time-frames, with support zones found near $0.20, $0.19, and $0.175, and with resistance zones ahead near $0.21, $0.23, $0.2475, and $0.26.

LTC/USD, 4-Hour Chart Analysis

LTC has been hit the hardest from a technical perspective in the past 48 hours, as after getting stuck below the key $64 level, it not just crashed below $56 but violated the key long-term $51 level as well, triggering a long-term sell signal. While a strong bounce above $51 could save LTC, and its previously dominant long-term trendline is safe, for now, bulls are facing several strong resistance levels following the rout of the past couple of days.

LTC is still now back on sell signals on both time-frames in our trend model, with support zones found near $44, and $38, and with resistance zones ahead near $51, $56, and $64.
