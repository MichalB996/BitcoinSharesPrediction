Ethereum has been among the frontrunners in the crypto market in terms of year-to-date performance. The number two cryptocurrency rose over 100% at the start of the year, fueled by the rapid growth of the decentralized finance movement.

The smart contract-based cryptocurrency is showing so much promise in the category, that one analyst believes that it will eventually replace Wall Street‚Äôs aging backend with its neutral settlement layer.

ETH Kicks Off 2020 With Strong Rally Following DeFi Milestone

Ethereum has been one of the best performing cryptocurrency assets of 2020. And before the coronavirus outbreak and stock market collapse set the entire crypto asset class back, the largest altcoin in the space had an ROI of 100% year-to-date.

But a fear-driven sell-off has pushed Ethereum prices back to yearly lows, and because a recession may be around the corner, these new assets are taking a serious beating.

However, Ethereum may have significant long-term value that will help the cryptocurrency survive whatever is to come in the financial world.

Although Ethereum is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, it shares only a few similarities. Bitcoin is designed for payments, storing wealth, and transferring said wealth.

Ethereum, however, is a smart-contract platform with nearly infinite potential use cases.

During the crypto hype bubble, Ethereum was used to launch initial coin offerings, helping to drive it to an all-time high price of $1,400.

But once that use case dried up, Etheruem‚Äôs value fell.

The enormous growth in the decentralized finance movement, however, has revived interest in Etheruem, and given it its best potential use case yet: replacing Wall Street‚Äôs back end.

According to the founder of Mythos Capital, another $500 million in bonds are in the pipeline for Ethereum and says the trend is likely to continue until the number two cryptocurrency completely replaces Wall Street‚Äôs back end.

Doing so could help Ethereum set a new all-time high in the months ahead as DeFi continues to grow.
