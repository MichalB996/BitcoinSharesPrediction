Fit Pay, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Nxt-ID, Inc. (NASDAQ: NXTD), today announced that it will begin shipping initial orders of Flipâ„¢, a new contactless payment device that enables Bitcoin holders to use the value of their currency to make contactless purchases at millions of retail locations.

Confirmed pre-orders of Flip will begin shipping on February 13, 2019.



"Flip bridges the gap between cryptocurrencies and traditional payments, providing Bitcoin holders the ability to use their value for everyday transactions," said Michael Orlando, COO of NXT-ID and President of Fit Pay, Inc. "We are very pleased that the first Flip users will have their devices soon."



Flip's near field communication (NFC) antenna allows it to transact payments at any retail point of sale location that accepts contactless payments. Flip stores a preloaded amount of U.S. dollars that are exchanged from the user's existing Bitcoin account. Flip includes a digital wallet that allows the user to set how much value they would like their Flip to hold and when they would like it to reload. Flip does not need to be charged. Non-fiat funds (i.e. cryptocurrency) must first be converted to U.S. Dollars before those funds are loaded onto Flip.



Consumers interested in purchasing Flip can order the device at FliptoPay.com. The retail price for Flip is $29. There are account and exchange fees associated with maintaining a Flip digital wallet. Flip is currently only available in the United States. For more information or to order Flip, visit FliptoPay.com.
