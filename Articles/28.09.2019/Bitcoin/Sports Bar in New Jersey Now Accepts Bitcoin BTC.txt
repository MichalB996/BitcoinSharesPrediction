Litecoin Foundation merchant ambassador Jon Moore stopped by a busy intersection in Elizabeth, New Jersey, the state’s fourth most populous city, to pin up brand new adoption signs for Bitcoin and Litecoin.

The latest merchant to open its doors to crypto enthusiasts is located two miles from Newark Liberty International Airport.

Terminal One Sports Bar will start accepting BTC and LTC, among other altcoins, from customers who want to make real-world crypto payments.

Against a backdrop of heavy traffic and noise, Moore explains why the location is key.

“They are also getting a Bitcoin ATM from CoinFlip. This is an awesome spot for adoption. Really busy drag going on in Elizabeth.

Right by Newark International Airport. It doesn’t get any better for adoption than this place.”

Moore goes on to paste the new BTC and LTC sticker on the entryway.

His mission is to drive adoption in high-traffic areas where people are encouraged to spend Litecoin like regular cash. He also imagines a world where cryptocurrencies are widely accepted, eliminating the need for world travelers to constantly exchange their money from one foreign currency into another.

“Look how busy it is here. This is an awesome, awesome sports bar. Come here for the football games. Now, since they’re right by Newark International Airport, it’s going to be the ultimate spot if somebody needs to buy crypto.

Maybe they’re leaving the country and they don’t want to convert into another currency. They want to convert into real money: Bitcoin or Litecoin.”
