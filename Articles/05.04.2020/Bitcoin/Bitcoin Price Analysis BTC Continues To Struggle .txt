Bitcoin fell by a total of 1.30% today as it currently trades at $6,789.

The cryptocurrency managed to poke itself above the upper boundary of the consolidation pattern but failed to close anywhere near the crucial $7,000 level.

Bitcoin managed to break above the upper boundary of the ascending triangle that we have been following but only ever so slightly. Moreover, the cryptocurrency failed to close anywhere near the crucial $7,000 level as it rolled over and dropped back into the triangle today.

This slight breakout above the triangle could easily be a false breakout signal as the volume is very low which resulted in Bitcoin dropping back into the consolidation today as it falls back beneath $6,800.
