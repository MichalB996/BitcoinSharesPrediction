Bitcoin is struggling to gain momentum above the key USD 7,000 resistance to the US dollar. BTC is likely to rise above $ 7,000 as long as it is above $ 6,400 and 100 SMA (H4).

Bitcoin price is currently showing some bearish signs below the USD 7,000 resistance area.

There is strong support above $ 6,400 and the simple moving average of 100 (4 hours).

An important bullish trend line is forming on the 4-hour chart of the BTC / USD pair (Kraken data feed) with support at USD 6,425.

The pair could make another attempt in the near future to exceed the $ 7,000 and $ 7,200 resistance levels.

Bitcoin holds crucial support

Bitcoin was trading higher than that last week Resistance levels of $ 6,400 and $ 6,500 against the US dollar. The BTC price even rose above the USD 7,000 resistance and was well above the simple moving average of 100 (4 hours).

It traded up to $ 7,273 before a downward correction was initiated. The price was below the $ 7,000 level to begin the correction. There was also an increase below the 50% fib retracement level of the upward move from the low of $ 6,150 to the high of $ 7,273.

The price tested the support area of ​​$ 6,600 and is currently consolidating in a series. The 61.8% fib retracement level appears to support the upward move from the low of $ 6,150 to the high of $ 7,273.

There is also an important bullish trend line with support of $ 6,425 in the 4 hours diagram of the BTC / USD pair. More importantly, the 100 simple moving average (4 hours) is close to the trend line and the support of $ 6,400.

If BTC does not stay above the $ 6,400 support and the $ 100 SMA, there is a risk of a significant decline. The next key support is near the $ 6,000 level, below which the $ 5,800 support area could even be tested.

Upside break

Bitcoin bulls need to protect the $ 6,400 support and the 100 SMA for another short-term increase. On the upside, an initial hurdle is near the $ 7,000 level.

A successful break above the USD 7,000 resistance level could trigger a strong rally above the USD 7,200 and USD 7,270 levels. The next big resistance is near the $ 7,500 level above which the price is likely to test the $ 7,880 level.
