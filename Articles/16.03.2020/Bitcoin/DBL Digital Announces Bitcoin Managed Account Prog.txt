DBL Digital, a division of DrawBridge Lending, announced on Monday the launch of its Bitcoin Managed Account Program (MAP) for individual and institutional investors.

According to DBL Digital, the program provides investors with exposure to the Crypto market in a risk-mitigated fashion, although virtual currency futures and options on futures present several risks related to the underlying virtual currency that should be considered prior to trading them.

DBL also noted that the program targets overlay returns at a specific upside call price and offers a hedge against bitcoin price declines. Speaking about the program, Jason Urban, CEO of DBL Digital, stated:

“Enhanced levels of volatility in Cryptocurrency markets have created exciting investment opportunities through traditional options strategies. We’ve developed the Bitcoin MAP to give investors exposure to Crypto along with an opportunity to capture enhanced returns on the price of bitcoin.”

DBL is also offering Accredited and Eligible Contract Participant (ECP) investors with additional opportunities through options hedging strategies to create yield on bitcoin held in a segregated wallet at a qualified custodian in cold storage. The company added that all of its programs provide clients with a “white-glove” service experience, operating within full risk mitigation and compliance.
