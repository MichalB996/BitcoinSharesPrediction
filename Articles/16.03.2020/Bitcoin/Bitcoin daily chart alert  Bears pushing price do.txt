(Kitco News) - Bitcoin-U.S. dollar prices are sharply down and not far from last week’s 12-month low in early U.S. trading Monday. Panicked global markets are sucking liquidity out of most markets, including Bitcoin. Low liquidity is generally bearish. “When in doubt, get out” is still traders’ mantra at present. Bitcoin bears are in solid near-term technical control amid a price downtrend in place on the daily bar chart. The path of least resistance for prices will remain sideways to lower until a bullish technical clue arises—and you will get that clue right here so stay tuned!-- By Jim Wyckoff For Kitco News Follow @jimwyckoff www.kitco.com
