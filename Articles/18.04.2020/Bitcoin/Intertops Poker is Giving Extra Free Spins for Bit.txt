“Bitcoins are safe and easy to use. Transaction fees are low also lower than other methods,” said Intertops Poker’s casino manager. “Our players have lots of options at the cashier, but more and more of them seem to prefer cryptocurrency.”

Take the Bank is a new cops and robbers slot game where Police Cars trigger 15 free spins with sticky wilds.
