In fact, David Miller, the attorney for Bitfinex was confident in quoting that Tether was investing many instruments which include Bitcoin along with cash and the equivalent of the same.

Tether Price Prediction and Conclusion:

Tether is neither bullish nor bearish as of now. The value is surely surging in a good direction, but investors consider Tether as a risky investment presently. After the final verdict from the court will decide if the users and followers are going to trust Tether back in the game or not.

Till then, they might want to play under the resistance level and support level between $1.01 and $0.993 respectively. The value might touch down $1.05 by the end of 2019 but only once the cloud is cleared above the heads of Tether Team.
