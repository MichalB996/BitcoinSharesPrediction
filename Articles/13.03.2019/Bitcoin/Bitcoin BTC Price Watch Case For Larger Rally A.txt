Bitcoin Price Analysis

Yesterday, we saw a downside reaction below the $3,860 support in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair tested the key $3,800 support level and later started an upside correction. A swing low was formed at $3,801 and the price corrected above the $3,840 level. Buyers were successful in pushing the price above the $3,850 resistance as well. Besides, there was a break above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $3,910 swing high to $3,800 swing low.

However, the recovery faced a strong resistance near the $3,880 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. More importantly, there is a key bearish trend line in place with resistance at $3,865 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair also struggled to clear the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $3,910 swing high to $3,800 swing low. At the moment, the price is consolidating just below the trend line, $3,870, and the 100 hourly SMA.

A successful break above the trend line and $3,880 could really boost the market sentiment. In the mentioned case, the price could climb above the $3,900 and $3,920 resistance levels. The next stop could be $3,960 or even $4,000. On the flip side, if there is a downside correction, the price may find buyers near the $3,840 level. The main support is near the $3,820 and $3,800 levels. If there is a downside break below $3,800, the price could move into a bearish zone in the near term.

Looking at the chart, bitcoin price seems to be preparing for a larger upside break above $3,880. Having said that, it won’t be easy for buyers to gain traction above $3,880 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.
