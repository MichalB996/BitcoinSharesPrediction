Bitcoin saw a 6% price decline over the past 24 hours of trading as it currently trades at $6,290.

The cryptocurrency has been trading within an ascending price channel since the March collapse but is in danger of dropping beneath this now.

Bitcoin rolled over and dropped by 6% today after failing to break above the $6,800 resistance level for the past 4-days straight. The cryptocurrency had seen some promising positive growth over the past week but is in danger of turning bearish again if it falls beneath the current rising price channel.

A drop beneath the channel could see Bitcoin breaking $6,000 and heading back toward $5,000 if the selling momentum increases. The RSI failed to break above the 50 level which shows that the sellers are still not ready to give up the control of the market momentum just yet.
