The leading cryptocurrency witnessed a drop of nearly 8% today as the price plunged to nearly $6,100. The drop in the price of bitcoin indicates that the cryptocurrency has not successfully decoupled from the traditional financial markets. If the pattern is followed, bitcoin is poised to crash below $5,000 over the weekend.

USA markets are expected to open down.

The primary factor that might trigger a downside movement of bitcoin is the US financial markets that are expected to open down. Currently, Dow Jones and S&P 500 both are down. Investors are likely to liquidate their assets after this weekâ€™s gains and take profit. Bitcoin is likely to drop below the $5,000 mark in the coming days.
