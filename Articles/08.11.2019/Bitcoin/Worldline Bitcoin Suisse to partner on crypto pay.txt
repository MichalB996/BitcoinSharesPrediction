Worldline, the Zurich-based payments giant, entered an agreement with Bitcoin Suisse on a partnership to allow in store and online crypto payments at Swiss merchants.

Worldline has a network of more than 65,000 merchants in Switzerland. Customers will be able to make purchases through Worldline's Six Payment Services unit. Bitcoin Suisse has a standalone point of sale solution for crypto payments that is already in use, according to a spokesperson for the firm.

"Our partnership with Worldline is an incredible step forward on the journey to bring crypto payments into broader adoption," Arthur Vayloyan, chief executive officer of Bitcoin Suisse, said in a company release. "Bitcoin Suisse is proud to serve as the processor of cryptocurrencies in Worldline's payment service symptom."

The companies plan to disclose additional details on the rollout during the upcoming Swiss Payment Forum next week in Zurich. A spokesman said the plan calls for a proof of concept, followed by a pilot program before a full rollout.

Worldline plans to expand the crypto payments program beyond Switzerland to operate across Europe.
