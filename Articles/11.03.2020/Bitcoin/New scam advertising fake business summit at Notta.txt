There’s a new scam circulating and this time it affects the Nottawasaga Inn & Resort in New Tecumseth.

Ontario Provincial Police say fraudsters are advertising a fictitious business conference called the International Fair Trade Business and Investors Summit, presumably taking place at the Inn between April 9-11.

Resort officials got suspicious and called police after they received several calls from the public inquiring about the summit, and were told people paid their registration in bitcoin.

Anyone with information regarding this incident is asked to contact the Nottawasaga OPP at 1-888-310-1122 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).
