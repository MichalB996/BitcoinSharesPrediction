The Human Rights Foundation (HRF), a New York-based non-profit charity, is now accepting bitcoin donations via open-source payment processor BTCPay Server.

The non-profit has been accepting bitcoin donations since 2014, but this is the first time it is using a payment processor, Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer of the HRF, told The Block.

“BTCPay Server helps protect the privacy of donors; has no centralized entity that would collect or exploit user information; and is nicely customizable,” said Gladstein.

The foundation also accepts donations in ether (ETH) and privacy-oriented coins such as monero (XMR) and zcash (ZEC), according to its website.

Last December, Gladstein appeared on a The Block podcast and said that bitcoin is creating a better future for human rights defenders and that it could exert a larger impact on the human rights scene than previously envisioned.



“Something that is going to decentralize the means of production of money and access to money will be remarkably powerful, especially as we move into a more cashless future where all money will be electronic,” he said at the time.
