Cloud mining usually refers to the process of Proof-of-Work mining (Bitcoin mining, Ethereum mining, Litecoin mining, etc.) via a remote data center that hosts and operates mining rigs. The customer needs to just ink a contract and get his/her share of the mining rewards. It's the best low-entry alternative to traditional mining as you don’t need to purchase expensive mining gear.

Typically, the user is asked to sign a contract for one month, three months, six months or a year, though lifetime cloud mining contracts are also available. Additionally, the user can customize the hashrate (performance indicator) he would like to borrow. In turn, he/she pays an initial payment and some periodic fees.

In this text, U.Today will explain the process of cloud mining and describe the best cloud mining sites as well as give you some basic advice on how to avoid scams in the shady sphere of cloud mining.

Before you start reading this text,

While reading the following article, please, keep in mind that every cloud mining service described below can be a high-risk investment option that may result in loss of part or all of your investments. The crypto market is still in its infancy, and many dramatic crashes occur here and there.

Always do your own research or contact a licensed financial advisor. Please, don't spend funds on cloud mining, the loss of which you can not absorb.

Introduction: What is cloud mining and why might it be profitable in 2020?

Most commonly, people try to guess what mining is (also ‘hash-mining’, ‘traditional Bitcoin mining’, ‘Ethereum mining’ etc.), what makes cloud mining special and whether it's profitable to start mining (or cloud mining) in 2020.

What is mining?

In a nutshell, mining refers to the calculation of hashes (transactional secrets) when adding new blocks to the blockchain. In turn, every transaction in a network is validated within these blocks. As a result, Bitcoin mining is required to maintain the performance and integrity of the Bitcoin network.

The quantity of hashes calculated (mined) during a particular period of time is also called the hash-rate. The overall hash-rate of the network is called network difficulty.

What is cloud mining?

Traditional mining is carried out via sophisticated hardware devices or mining rigs. E.g. one of the most widespread mining computers, Antminer S17, now costs $1,200, though you need at least a dozen of them to mine profitably.

Instead, you can sign a mining contract and borrow some mining devices from a high-end mining entity. Typically, such mining giants are established by engineers and developers in areas with very cheap electricity (Far East, Northern China, Georgia, Abkhazia, etc.) and tolerant legislation. Borrowing a share of mining capacity for a prescribed period of time is called cloud mining.

Cloud mining in 2020: Is it profitable?

Bitcoin mining is profitable because every new block and every validated transaction is rewarded with a predetermined sum in Bitcoin. As such, Bitcoin miners are incentivized economically to support the existence and development of the network. But after every 210,000 blocks, the mining reward decreases by 50%. This type of event is hard-coded into the Bitcoin network software and, therefore, occurs every 4 years.

This decrease, namely ‘halving’ or ‘halvening’, is of crucial importance to the Bitcoin network. The next (third) halving will occur in the early days of May 2020. Many analysts believe the Bitcoin price, after halving, will rise significantly. As such, it may be very profitable to start mining in 2020.

And it may be even more profitable to start cloud mining in 2020 because, in this case, you won’t need to purchase new mining equipment and customize it and, therefore, heavily invest in mining.

Is this cloud mining website a scam?

A cloud mining website is typically the site of a provider of cloud mining services. It offers various tariffs, shows the customer agreement form and informs visitors of their fee policy. Also, you can find up-to-date information about promo campaigns and regularly track the income you receive from cloud mining.

Firstly: how to avoid cloud mining scams

As the contractor typically is not able to physically access the mining rig he/she is receiving passive income from, the sphere of cloud mining is a true bonanza for all types of brazen fraudsters.

Two types of scams are the most common in cloud mining: Ponzi schemes and exit scams. Within the framework of the Ponzi scheme, cloud mining rewards for early contractors are generated only from the payments of new contractors. Mining rigs are not necessary here and can be non-existent. With exit scams, nobody receives any rewards besides the fraudster behind the scheme.

Two basic tips to avoid cloud mining scams

Transparency first. Never invest in cloud mining from a ‘secret project’ whose mining gear works in a ‘hidden’ location. Verify all documents: contracts, licenses, etc. Don’t hesitate to contact the cloud mining team and ask them any questions. Many secrets shill many scams.

There's no ‘free lunch’ in this world. Avoid free cloud mining sites. If someone offers you a cloud mining share for free (for review, as a promo, etc.), he/she is a scammer.

This cloud mining platform has a great advantage as it operates mining capacities in Northern regions of the Russian Federation where electricity rates are really low.

Crypto Universe offers two types of contracts: ‘BTC Mining’ and ‘Cloud Miners’. The first one looks classic: you borrow a share in the company’s hash-rate in exchange for periodic fees. With the ‘Cloud Miners’ option, you can borrow your own mining computer for a period of time. The ‘Beginner’ tariff plan with ‘BTC Mining’ starts at $9.

With the most profitable tariff plan, you can earn up to 0.1 BTC/month with a high-end AvalonMiner 1066 mining machine.
