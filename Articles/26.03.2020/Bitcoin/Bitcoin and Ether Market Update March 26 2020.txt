The mid-week session on Wednesday was a volatile one. Bitcoin was trading between $7,000 – $6,400 during intraday. The leading cryptocurrency failed to break the $7,000 line and was forced to close with a loss to $6,684.

Buyers successfully confirmed their position $6,400 after a second straight close there, but a proper consolidation is still required, which will set the ground for yet another attack of $7,000.

The third day of the workweek came with the exact same candle being formed on the daily chart, however, in the opposite direction as the ETH token erased all gains from the previous session and moved back down to $136.

The next target for bulls is to make an attempt to climb above the $150 S/R line, which can be followed by a potential continuation to $175. Down, it is the current support at $120, then the last visited low at $108 that is supposed to react to bears pressure.
