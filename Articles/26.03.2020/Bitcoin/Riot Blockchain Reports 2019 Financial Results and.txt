Fiscal Year 2019 Financial Results

Total mining revenue in 2019 was $6.7 million compared to $7.7 million in 2018.

Gross profit, which is computed as mining revenues in excess of cost of revenues (excluding depreciation and amortization), was $644,000 (9.6% of total mining revenues), as compared to $1.9 million (24.9% of total mining revenues) in 2018. The decreases in revenue and gross profit were primarily due to changes in cryptocurrency prices as well as increases in the difficulty index associated with solving mining algorithms.

Selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses in 2019 decreased 56% to $9.2 million from $20.9 million in 2018. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to reductions in staff, decreases in stock-based compensation expense, consulting fees, and legal fees, which were slightly offset by increases in audit and related professional fees.

Net loss for 2019 was $20.3 million, or $(1.02) per share, compared to net loss of $60.2 million, or $(4.33) per share, in 2018.

At December 31, 2019, the Company had $11.3 million in cash and cryptocurrencies, as compared to $932,000 at December 31, 2018.
