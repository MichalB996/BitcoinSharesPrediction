Coinsource, a Texas-based bitcoin ATM operator, announced a partnership with the Maker Foundation to make the Dai stablecoin available on its machines this summer in preparation for the launch of a full remittance service.

Coinsource will be updating all of its 230 machines in 29 US states and the District of Columbia to allow customers to buy, sell, and store Dai stablecoins.

Phase two of the rollout will launch a remittance service allowing crypto ATM and Dai users to send cash from wallet to wallet, enabling recipients to instantly redeem funds at any Coinsource machine or supported location.

Like Facebook’s Libra, Coinsource is hoping to extend financial services to an underserved and unbanked population.

“By offering support for Dai, we can provide the benefits of crypto to customers who are without access to bank accounts, while at the same time allowing them to avoid the price volatility typically associated with today’s often fluctuating crypto markets,” said Sheffield Clark, CEO of Coinsource, in a statement.

MakerDAO limits the effects of market volatility through a 1:1 soft peg to the U.S. dollar, maintained with an underlying basket of crypto assets, Collateralized Debt Positions, and automated stability mechanisms.

Additionally, MakerDAO lets users lock up ethereum as collateral via a smart contract in exchange for Dai. Roughly 2 percent – equivalent to over $340 million – of all ethereum is locked in DAO’s decentralized finance application.

Steven Becker, COO of the Maker Foundation said this partnership will remove some of the barriers to enter the decentralized, permissionless economy.

The remittance service is currently only available in the U.S.
