Website Shows Oversold and Overbought Cryptos

The RSI Hunter website lists hundreds of cryptocurrencies and tokens classifying them as oversold, neutral or overbought. Its analysis is based on data pulled from leading digital asset exchanges like Binance, Okex, Bittrex, and others. It also uses several base currencies such as BTC, BNB and USDT to produce comparable results.

Besides choosing a trading platform and a base currency, you can set different timeframes as well â€“ from one minute to one week. RSI Hunter will then offer you examples in all three mentioned categories. The price of each crypto is shown both in U.S. dollars and the respective base currency, along with weekly and monthly highs and lows. Prices and relative strength indexes are updated every minute.

The tables contain a number of relevant indicators including moving average, standard deviation and average volume for various time periods. RSI Hunter supplies you with charts as well, which show the 14-day percentage change in the prices of the coins and tokens. A pivot point is estimated for each cryptocurrency.

To stay in touch with major crypto markets at all times, you can also use Bitcoin Markets. The tool has been developed by Bitcoin.com to provide you with real-time data about the prices and market valuations of hundreds of coins. You can view charts showing changes in price, capitalization, hashrate, and fees for both BCH and BTC using the Bitcoin Charts page.
