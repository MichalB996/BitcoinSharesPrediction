Plouton Mining plans to build a solar-powered bitcoin mining facility in Western Mojave, California. The panels will take up 49 of the 50 acres of the facility and will generate 10-to-13 Megawatts of energy for 330 days a year for 12 hours a day, according to a press release.

Plouton selected the Western Mojave region due to it being covered in sunlight around 70% of the year. The company plans to contract with local utility providers to cut operating costs when the sun sets, according to the release.

"The preeminent combination of nature and technology will usher in the next stage of bitcoin mining evolution, fulfilling the promise of bitcoin as a sustainable, decentralized network of transactions. We are very pleased to offer people the opportunity to participate in the growing Bitcoin blockchain economy without having to purchase the mining equipment themselves."
