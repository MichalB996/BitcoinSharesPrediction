tZERO has launched a new app that combines a digital wallet with exchange services. The company, funded by Medici Ventures, launched a security token trading platform last January.

The app, called the tZERO Crypto App, will also users to trade bitcoin and ethereum and includes a private key recovery system that will keep coins safe if you lose a phone or device.

“The tZERO Crypto App is a significant milestonein our plans to provide an intuitive experience for trading all digital assets,” tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi said in a statement.

The app is available for iOS and is coming to Android “soon,” according to the firm.

CoinDesk reported back in March that the firm was looking to release a crypto-buying app. At the time, Noursalehi said that the app was being developed by the team from Bitsy, a firm previously acquired by tZERO, and that in the long-term, the plan is for the app to allow trading of security tokens that are listed on tZERO’s exchange.

The firm, which grew out of e-retail giant Overstock’s efforts to develop businesses in the blockchain space, is perhaps best known for its alternative trading system (ATS) for tokens. The token platform opened in late January after years of development, though to date the only token available for trading is one issued directly by tZERO.
