PR: CheapAir.com and Bitcoin.com Partner to Serve Bitcoin Cash Travelers

CALABASAS, CA (July 31, 2019) – Online travel agency CheapAir.com and Bitcoin.com today announced a partnership to serve crypto travelers. Beginning today, more than 4 million Bitcoin.com Wallet users will be able to access CheapAir.com’s booking engine from their mobile app. The partnership will help crypto travelers find the best deals on flights and hotels around the world.

In 2013, CheapAir.com became the first U.S.-based online travel agency to accept Bitcoin payments for flights and hotels. CheapAir.com now accepts payment in Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dash. We’ve worked to build a loyal following of crypto users over the years, and build a strong technical platform to support them.

“At CheapAir.com we’re big fans of Bitcoin and we believe people deserve the freedom to use whatever payment methods that fit their lifestyle and values,” said Jeff Klee, CEO of CheapAir.com. “We wanted to partner with Bitcoin.com because of the great work they have done within the Bitcoin community, promoting crypto acceptance around the world. We value our crypto customers and support their efforts to build a more diverse and evolved financial system.”

“Bitcoin.com is really excited to spread real world BCH adoption with CheapAir. Paying for flights and hotels with Bitcoin Cash has never been easier,” said Stefan Rust, CEO of Bitcoin.com.

Travelers who book at CheapAir.com with a cryptocurrency are covered by Price Drop Payback™, which offers up to $100 USD in travel credit if airfares go down after purchase.

CheapAir.com also offers a ton of data and analytics to help travelers get the best airfares. Travelers can use the When to Buy Flights widget to find pricing patterns for an itinerary or check out the newest airfare study to learn about the macrotrends.
