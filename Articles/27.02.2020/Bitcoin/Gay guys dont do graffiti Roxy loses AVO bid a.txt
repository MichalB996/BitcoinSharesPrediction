Publicist Roxy Jacenko has failed a court bid to obtain a restraining order against a patron she clashed with at a glossy event after a magistrate found her claims of being in fear of the flamboyant businessman were "grossly exaggerated", "hollow and unpersuasive".

The reality television star, who also accused Bitcoin trader Anthony Hess of spray painting "Roxy is a c---" on the outside of her Paddington business, left the Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney in tears on Thursday, while the Melbourne businessman emerged slinging insults at his former "idol".

"Gay guys don't do graffiti," Mr Hess said outside court.

Denying the act of vandalism while in the witness box earlier, Mr Hess said "that's not my style".
