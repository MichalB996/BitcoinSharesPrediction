Why Jump Into Cryptos?

Although crypto have been trading in a similar way to risk assets since the COVID-19 crash started, they may hold up well in the medium term. The simple fact is that global monetary authorities have decided to rapidly embark on an extraordinary takeover of the world biggest markets (the US stock and bond markets, among others) which is, at best, very dangerous.

Cryptos are a relatively new asset class, but they are the only one that fully leverages the global information infrastructure to allow people to trade freely. This is an amazing capability, and it may lead to much higher crypto prices over the next decade.
