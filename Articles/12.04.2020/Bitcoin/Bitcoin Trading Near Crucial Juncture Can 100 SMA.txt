The pair could start a strong rally if it stays above the $6,700 support and the 100 SMA (H4).

Bitcoin is Testing Crucial Support

This past week, bitcoin made a few attempts to surpass the $7,400 and $7,500 resistance levels against the US Dollar, but it failed. BTC price traded as high as $7,470 and recently started a fresh decline.

It broke the $7,200 support level to move into a bearish zone. The bears pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $6,617 low to $7,470 high.

More importantly, there was a break below a major bullish trend line with support at $7,200 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price is now trading near a crucial support at $6,700 and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours).

It is also trading near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $6,617 low to $7,470 high. If the price fails to stay above the $6,700 support and the 100 SMA (H4), there is a risk of more losses in the near term.

The next key support is near the $6,400 area since it is close to the 1.236 Fib extension level of the upward move from the $6,617 low to $7,470 high. Any further losses may perhaps lead the price towards the $6,080 support area in the near term.

Fresh Rally?

If bitcoin stays above the $6,700 support and the 100 SMA, it could start a fresh increase. An initial resistance on the upside is near the $6,950 and $7,000 levels.

The first major resistance is seen near the $7,100 level, above which the price is likely to gain strength. The next key resistance is near the $7,400 and $7,500 levels.
