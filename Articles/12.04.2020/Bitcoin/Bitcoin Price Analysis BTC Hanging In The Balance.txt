Bitcoin dropped from $7,400 yesterday and fell back beneath $7,000 but managed to find the support at the $6,800 level. This price is an important level as it provided a strong level of resistance from the market during the late half of March 2020 and therefore is expected to provide strong support moving forward.

We can see how $6,800 had provided resistance for the market during both late-March and early April and therefore it is expected to provide strong support moving forward. However, a break beneath $6,800 could prove to be devastating for Bitcoin as it would unwind toward the $6,000 level.

Short term prediction: Bullish

Bitcoin remains bullish right now but is in strong danger of turning neutral if it drops beneath $6,800.

Support toward the downside is located at $6,800, $6,765, $6,500, $6,300, $6,100, and $6,000.

On the other hand, if the buyers climb higher, resistance lies at $7,000, $7,174, $7,400, $7,500, and $7,676.
