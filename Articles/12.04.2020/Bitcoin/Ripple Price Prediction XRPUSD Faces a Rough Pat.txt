XRP Price Prediction â€“ April 12

XRP/USD followed a decent rise over the past few days as the coin now appears to be resuming a bullish run.

XRP/USD Market

Key Levels:

Resistance levels: $0.23, $0.24, $0.25

Support levels: $0.15, $0.14, $0.13

XRP/USD has seen a small increase of around 2.54% as the market opens today and it currently trades at $0.192 above the 9-day and 21-day moving averages. The coin still has hard times moving above the $0.18 level as the previous attempts so far have failed. Despite this, XRP/USD has seen a 2.54% price hike and it remains the third-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $8.41 billion.

Moreover, in the last couple of days, the Ripple price has remained relatively strong to the extent that the gains above the vital $0.20 have been acutely steady. At the same time, the movement to a downward trend has been cut short. In the early hours of today, the Ripple price has gone down from $0.191 to $0.181.

Furthermore, a significant cross above the key resistance could sustain the bulls to $0.21 high. Meanwhile, Ripple is currently on an upward trend and still maintaining it. If XRP manages to surge above $0.22, it may see the resistance levels at $0.23, $0.24 and $0.25. The RSI (14) indicator is showing some fade bullish signals.

Against Bitcoin, before this time, the market price was moving in sideways and trading within the descending channel. For now, XRP/BTC is trading at 2728 SAT and expecting a break out of the channel. Now, looking at the daily chart, both the bulls and the bears are struggling with who will dominate the market.

However, if the market drops, the next key supports will likely be at 2550 SAT and below. On the bullish side, a possible rise could push the market to the resistance levels of 2950 SAT and 3050 SAT. According to the RSI (14), the market is moving in sideways around 54-level, which could trigger more bullish signals in the market soon.
