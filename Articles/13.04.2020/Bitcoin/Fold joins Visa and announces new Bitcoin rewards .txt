Fold customers can decide whether to save, withdraw or spend Bitcoin earned from everyday spending. It can also be used to offset the cost of future purchases.

Fold CEO, Will Reeves, was clearly delighted at the announcement, hailing it as a way for new people to get involved in cryptocurrency.

He said: “The card provides an easy way for consumers to earn rewards in Bitcoin for their everyday spending. What we noticed is that plenty of people are interested in participating in the growing bitcoin economy but aren’t sure how to get started. Fold makes it easy for anyone to get their first piece of bitcoin when using the Fold card to earn bitcoin rewards on any purchase.”
