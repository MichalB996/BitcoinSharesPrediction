Bitcoin might be in for a reversal from its uptrend as price formed a head and shoulders pattern and is breaking below the neckline. This could set off a drop that’s the same height as the chart formation.

The reversal pattern spans $6,800 to $7,400 so the resulting slide could be roughly $600. The 100 SMA is above the 200 SMA to indicate that the uptrend is still more likely to gain traction than to reverse, though. Price has fallen below the 100 SMA dynamic inflection point as an early indicator of selling pressure.

Volume is elevated to suggest that the breakdown could gain more traction from here. Price could be aiming for the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point at $6,400 next as stochastic points lower to confirm the presence of selling momentum.

ADX is moving sideways but is above the 25 mark to suggest trending market conditions.

Bitcoin has been selling off as risk appetite returned to the markets on account of the OPEC plan to curb production in order to lift prices. This comes after another round of stimulus efforts from the US government to boost businesses and consumer activity amid the slump from the outbreak containment.

With that, bitcoin could see further downside momentum if the measures kick in and support the global economy. Other central banks and governments are expected to keep pumping stimulus to limit the impact of a looming recession, although worsening numbers could still support bitcoin demand.

Note that the halving of mining rewards is approaching in May and this could mean a potential doubling of the coin’s value, so investors might be keen to set their long positions ahead. Of course most bulls might opt to wait for bargain prices and wait until much later on to buy on dips.
