The cryptocurrency firm is expanding its board with a 30-year veteran of Credit Suisse.

Bitcoin Suisse is appointing Giles Keating to its board, effective May 1, the company said in a statement on Friday. Previously the head of Credit Suisse's research department, Keating is to help position Bitcoin Suisse as a partner for global institutional investors.

Keating left the Swiss bank in 2016 to co-found Werthstein, a robo adviser. The venture folded last year after it failed to win enough clients.

Bitcoin Suisse also said Urs Bigger (pictured below) will take over as vice-chairman of its board. Bigger has been instrumental in developing a legal and compliance framework for Bitcoin Suisse since joining in 2017.

From next month, Bitcoin Suisse's board will be comprised of Niklas Nikolajsen, founder and chairman, Urs Bigger as his deputy, Giles Keating , Luzius Meisser, and Arthur Vayloyan, the company's CEO.
