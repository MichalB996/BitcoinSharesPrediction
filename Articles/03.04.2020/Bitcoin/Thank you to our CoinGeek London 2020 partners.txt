We are so appreciative for the support of our corporate partners, who are devoted to helping the Bitcoin ecosystem grow and demonstrate the real utility of Bitcoin SV (BSV). Together, weâ€™re able to show the capabilities of blockchain technology and Bitcoin as Satoshi had designed. At the CoinGeek Conference in London, we saw some unique ways that businesses can use blockchain dataâ€”from EHR Data to immutably store and manage healthcare data to UNISOT showing how BSV can be used to enhance traceability & sustainability in the supply chain.

Thank you to the Bitcoin Association, Bitstocks, Blockchain Domes, nChain and TAAL.
