“Don’t waste a good crisis.”

It’s a helpful mantra for tough times. There will be much difficulty and suffering in the days ahead, yes, but also a magnificent opportunity to reinvent, rebrand, and rebuild.

You may know of Geoffrey Moore, the author of the classic business book Crossing the Chasm. Here’s what he recently tweeted:

From now until June, you have an opportunity to do something you wouldn’t normally do.

It’s like a portal has opened up. This portal goes to another dimension, an alternate reality where you are somehow better and stronger. Your business has been reinvented. You have personally been transformed.

But the portal is only open for the next few weeks. Eventually, it will close. The Jell-O of the universe will congeal into a New Normal.

The New Normal won’t be the same. Power structures will change. Industries will consolidate. There will be no Olive Garden.

In that New Normal, where will you be?

Simon Sinek, the famous author and TED Talker, held an inspiring Zoom chat where he talked about this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for reinvention. Highly recommended (6 minutes well spent):







The world is not ending, the world is changing. Jump through the portal. Seize the opportunity.

You won’t see a time like this again. Don’t let a perfectly good crisis go to waste.

5 Business Best Practices During the Coronacrisis:

> Teach others what you are learning. (Teach it to someone else, and you’ve really learned it.)

> Get to your desk before 8:30 am. Get something done before 9.

> Don’t get it perfect, get it done. Think fast, cheap, agile.

> Do quick “Zoom scrums” where you check in with team members: 15 minutes or less.

> Spend 10% of your time helping others.
