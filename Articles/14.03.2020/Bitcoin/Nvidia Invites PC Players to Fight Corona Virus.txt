The Corona virus has now spread to more than a hundred countries, and researchers are constantly working to deal with the virus. If you too want to support scientists’ research, you can donate some of your GPU power.

Did you know that you can use your computer to fight the Corona virus seen in 5 people according to the official figures announced in our country? You can especially use the graphics power of your computers to fight the Covid-19 outbreak.

The power of the GPU in the fight against the epidemic

Nvidia called on computer players, asked them to download the “Folding @ home” application to their computers and help scientists fight the virus. The downloaded program connects computers to an international network. This network uses distributed processing power for large amounts of computing. When you don’t want to, you can close the program and start using your entire GPU again.

Folding @ home is not actually a new project. This system, which can also be used on PlayStation 3s in time, allows users to use the reserved process in research. The option to simulate potentially compatible protein targets in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses was added earlier this week.

Such projects contribute to researchers’ understanding the virus better and even developing treatment. You can also help scientists fight the virus by installing Folding @ home. The only thing you need to do for this is to make some of your computer’s GPU power available to researchers when you are not using it.

If you want to contribute to both Corona virus research and other diseases by downloading Folding @ home, you can download the necessary program and access more detailed information about the project by going to the foldinghome website.
