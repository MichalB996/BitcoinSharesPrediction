Massive and novel government intervention in markets is now a foregone conclusion, but what happens to bitcoin (BTC) as the dust settles?

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve's New York branch announced more than a trillion dollars in liquidity injections into the market. In the coming weeks, many observers expect trillions of more in stimulus in a variety of exotic new intervention tactics.

The challenge of global coordination for a new Bretton Woods

Why in the wake of stimulus some governments might turn to bitcoin

The three factors that lead to currency failure
