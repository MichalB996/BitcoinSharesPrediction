Liquid, a second layer tech for bitcoin created by Blockstream, just onboarded another crypto partner.

The sidechain for faster BTC payments now has around 30 members, including Bitfinex, BITMex, OKCoin, and other exchanges, with the total of $900,000 moving around on the network, Blockstream’s chief strategy officer Samson Mow told CoinDesk.

Now Canadian bitcoin exchange Bull Bitcoin is joining the platform. The new partnership will allow the users of Bull Bitcoin to interact with other exchanges on the network.

Tentatively scheduled on the early 2020, the integration of Liquid tech into Bull Bitcoin’s operations will require some effort from the exchange’s tech team, Bull Bitcoin CEO Francis Pouliot said.

“We’re making sure we have this backup layer. We want to make sure bitcoin succeeds, and this is our way to participate in strengthening the network,” Pouliot told CoinDesk.

As a part of the partnership, Bull Bitcoin is going to issue its own asset on the Liquid network: Canadian dollar-pegged token dubbed L-CAD, which is supposed to be used as the exchange’s voucher for buying bitcoin.
