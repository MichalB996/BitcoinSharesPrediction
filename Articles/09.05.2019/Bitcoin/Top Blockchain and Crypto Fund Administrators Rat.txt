Blockchain and crypto fund administrators enable digital asset fund managers to focus on managing their portfolios by taking care of all administrative tasks required to run a fund.

In this guide, you will discover a list of the best crypto fund administrators that are supporting the digital asset fund ecosystem in 2019.

What Is Digital Asset Fund Administration?

In the established financial markets, a fund administration services provider is a third-party that enables portfolio managers to focus exclusively on generating a return on investment by handling all administrative tasks required to run an investment fund for them.

A fund administratorâ€™s activities include, but are not limited to, net asset value (NAV) calculations, financial reporting, preparation of reports for stakeholders, accounting services, managing fund bank accounts, and compliance monitoring and reporting. Crypto fund administrators perform the same functions but for investment funds that are investing exclusively in digital currencies and tokens.

Currently, there are around half a dozen crypto fund administration services providers, ranging from established financial institutions to recently launched startups.
