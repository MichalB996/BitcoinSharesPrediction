Perma Bull Tom Lee Predicts BTC Market Prices Could Tap New Highs

Fundstrat Global Advisors cofounder Tom Lee is well known for his price predictions and many people consider his opinions to be extremely bullish. On Feb. 4, Lee told the press that he is “really optimistic” about BTC prices in the short term and has made another prediction. “January is usually a week month, it was a great month for bitcoin, [which is] up 26% — but also recovered its 200-day moving average,” Lee told Yahoo Finance. “That’s a big deal as you know, as anyone [who follows trends] knows when you’re back above your 200-day, you’re back in a bull market. Whenever bitcoin breaks back into its 200-day, its average six-month gain is 197%,” the Fundstrat executive said.

Wealth Manager Expects BTC Prices to Jump to $400k by 2030

On a Citizen Bitcoin podcast hosted by Brady Swenson, a California-based investment advisor from the firm Wescap said that he believes hyperbitcoinization will happen. “I think the total valuation on 10 years that I use is about $8 trillion and that comes from various buckets,” said Andy Edstrom. “Whether it’s taking share from gold, or taking share from fiat, or taking share from offshore assets, or slightly demonetizing other stores of value like real estate or new uses that we haven’t thought of, or are still under construction, such as micropayments,” explained Wescap’s Edstrom. The wealth manager noted that severe geopolitical tensions and the mass printing of fiat reserves could push more people toward BTC. Edstrom has written a book called “Why Buy Bitcoin,” and the investment advisor discusses the examination with Swenson throughout the podcast episode.
