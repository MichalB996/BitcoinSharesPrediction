Bitcoin: Traders expect 'instant gratification' from the cryptocurrency

The value of bitcoin peaked at almost £15,592.50 ($20,000) in December 2017 but has tumbled over time to around 80 percent from its record high. The crypto giant enjoyed a healthy start to this year, even smashing through the psychologically important $4,000-mark, fuelling hopes a long-term recovery could be on the cards. But BTC has since pulled back to $3,587.22 as of 11.30AM UK time, down 0.7 percent from opening levels. While the fluctuation of bitcoin is notoriously hard to predict, Marcus Swanepoel, CEO at top currency exchange Luno, is anticipating an “exciting year ahead” for bitcoin.

However, major movement in the cryptocurrency market will fail to tackle demands placed on BTC, said Mr Swanepoel, who suggested “instant gratification” is expected from the cryptocurrency. He said: “One big challenge we believe the industry still faces is that of instant gratification. “Everyone wants cryptocurrency to be the same or better than the existing financial system overnight. “The reality is that the existing financial system was built over hundreds - if not thousands - of years and we’re not going to build a new financial infrastructure overnight.

“While we believe that cryptocurrency will one day be all of these things (and more), we need to be patient and take it one step at a time. “The stakes are high and it would be irresponsible and potentially outright dangerous to rush things.” “After last week’s comment on BTC around the $4,000 level, the last week of trading has seen very little to continue to push Bitcoin upwards, with a clear move to the downside and establishing new lows for 2019. “From talking to various sources in the industry there is still expectation of a continued move lower for the largest cryptocurrency with several citing $1,500 level as a potential ‘bottom’.” BTC fell 13 percent last week, following a short-term corrective bounce from the December low of £2,429 ($3,122).
