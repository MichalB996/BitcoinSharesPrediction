A small town in Canada is experimenting with letting residents pay some of their property taxes with bitcoin.

Innisfil, located in southern Ontario, will launch a one-year pilot program in April to see if the cryptocurrency is a viable alternative.

Residents who navigate to the town’s website to pay an installment of their property taxes will see the new payment option. Initially, only bitcoin will be supported although other currencies like ethereum and litecoin may be added in the future.

‘Once again, we are proud to be first in taking this bold step by offering this new, exciting payment option to our residents,” said Innisfil’s mayor Lynn Dollin in a statement.

‘By getting into this now, we are making sure our municipality is ahead of the game, and signalling to the world that we truly are a future-ready and innovative community.’

The town is partnering with a Toronto-based company called Coinberry that will take the crypto payments and change them into Canadian dollars before transferring them to the coffers of Innisfil.

‘I think this is really exciting, it is history in the making for Canada,’ said Andrei Poliakov, CEO of Coinberry.

‘If you pay with credit card you’re going to pay 3.5 per cent fees, if you pay with cryptocurrency, you’re going to pay half, there is a cost saving right there.’

The digital currency hit its all-time peak on December 17, 2017 when one bitcoin was worth £15,800 but has slumped dramatically since.

Supporters still maintain the the decentralised digital currency is the future of finance, cutting out banks and providing end-to-end encryption for all payments.
