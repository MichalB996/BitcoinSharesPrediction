Ring in the new bitcoin halving cycle the right way: with us!

Bitcoin Magazine presents non-stop coverage of Bitcoin’s third Halving with hours of commentary and analysis from Bitcoin 2020 speakers and some of our closest friends.

The Halving (sometimes referred to as “ the Halvening ”) is the predetermined moment when Bitcoin’s block subsidy gets cut in half. The halving of Bitcoin’s block subsidy occurs every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years) and is a key feature of Bitcoin.

People will always need banking but now, more than ever, we’re beginning to see that people don’t necessarily need banks. Emerging apps such as Pei offer consumers opportunities to grow their finances without relying on credit card companies. In this episode of the Bitcoin Magazine Podcast, Dave Hollerith interviews Tom Bachar, co-founder and CEO of Pei, to find out how that’s possible.

Pei is a mobile card-linked, cash-back app with banking functionalities that helps people save money. Users link their existing debit or credit cards to the app and then, when they make purchases at select merchants, get rewarded in BTC or cash.

Beyond diving into what services Pei offers to users, the two discuss how it makes money and how it treats user data.
