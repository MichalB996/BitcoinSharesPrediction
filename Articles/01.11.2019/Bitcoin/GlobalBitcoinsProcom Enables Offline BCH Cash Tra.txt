GlobalBitcoinsPro.com Enables Offline BCH Cash Trades

This is a paid press release, which contains forward looking statements, and should be treated as advertising or promotional material. Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release.

After the devastating news of the removal of offline cash trades and the new vigorous and intrusive KYC policy from popular P2P Exchange Platform (Localbitcoins) the community needed an alternative. We’re happy to announce the arrival of GlobalBitcoinsPro.com which has been created to revive the community.

Created by a group of OTC traders that grew from trading on Localbitcoins and noticed a decline in the community they were used to, they simply “Wanted to bring back the glory days”.

GlobalBitcoinsPro.com is a peer-to-peer (p2p) cryptocurrency exchange platform, it is the newest and most reliable platform allowing users to safely perform both online and offline trades. Their main attraction is the familiar, popular and easy to use interface that many traders already know how to use making it easier to just make an account and start creating ads and trading. They also added new and exciting features that serve two communities by offering the choice of trading between BTC (Bitcoin Core) & BCH (Bitcoin Cash). One of their primary objectives is to facilitate the efficient trade of cryptocurrencies on a global scale, which will ultimately result in a digital community coming together. GlobalBitcoinsPro.com has a very convenient, easy to use functionality making the usage of this platform smooth and hassle-free. This platform is available worldwide with active users in multiple countries. They have also competitively slashed fees in half by charging only half a percent as opposed to the competition that charges 1% fees on all trades.

Filling the gap in the market of p2p cryptocurrency trading platforms

After recognising a gap in the market, when the market leaders took down their offline trading features, they decided to fill that gap by recreating a similar platform with added features allowing users to trade with physical cash once again. A popular platform ‘LocalBitcoins’ took down offline trades early June resulting in numerous complaints and loyal users having no support. GlobalBitcoinsPro.com swiftly filled this and brought offline trades back therefore allowing users to still have an option for either offline and online trades.

Enabling more access to Crypto Currencies in developing countries where banks cannot reach

GlobalBitcoinsPro.com has worked on bringing the world of Crypto Currencies to every city and they are constantly expanding. This allows the access to Crypto Currencies to stretch globally to developing countries that would usually be ignored by the traditional banking world. This is evidently not only a platform just for trading, but they are also looking to advance the community and introducing Crypto to the world economy.
