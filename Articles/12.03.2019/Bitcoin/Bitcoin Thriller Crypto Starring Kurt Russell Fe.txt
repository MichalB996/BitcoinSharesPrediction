The official trailer for ‘Crypto’ starring Kurt Russell and Luke Hemsworth just dropped. The Hollywood thriller is billed as a cross between “The Firm and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” where “Fear is the Ultimate Currency.”

﻿

Directed by John Stalberg Jr., Crypto tells the story of a young agent named Martin, played by Beau Knapp, who returns to his hometown in New York to untangle a web of deceit, corruption and fraud. The film serves up Russian operatives, guns and the kind of maneuvering that makes cryptocurrency good for the bad guys: money laundering.

Ethereum, Waves, Stellar and NEO make cameo appearances.

Crypto will hit theaters in limited release and on-demand on April 12th.
