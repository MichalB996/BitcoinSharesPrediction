Bitcoin Where You Can Spend Your Bitcoin in 2020

Bitcoin catches a lot of flack because of its low transaction throughput and at times, higher fees and wild volatility. These can make it impractical to use for small purchases like coffee. However, let’s take a look at where you can actually use Bitcoin to buy stuff in the real world in 2020.

Even though Bitcoin may not be the most convenient cryptocurrency to use for smaller consumer purchases, due to its 10 minute confirmation times, varying transaction fees, and slower throughput, more places are accepting it as payment.

Things are changing though. Segwit has wrangled in fees to an extent, the lightning network is seeing more integration and development, and a possible soft fork to add schnorr signatures and taproot is in the works too. These advances are making Bitcoin more usable and less clunky.
