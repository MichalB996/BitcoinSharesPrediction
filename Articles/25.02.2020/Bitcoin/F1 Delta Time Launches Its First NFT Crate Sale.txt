F1 Delta Time, a racing game by Animoca Brands that leverages non-fungible tokens (NFTs), officially launched its first crate sale on Monday.

According to the sale’s announcement, 6,500 crates across 4 tiers, Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary, are now available for purchase with Ethereum (ETH). With each tier signifying the rarity of the collectibles found in the crate.

These NFTs include two main types of cars and drivers. The first type is official F1 drivers and cars from the 2019 Formula 1 season, which are available as Epic and Legendary NFTs. The second type is original cars and drivers that are exclusive to the game. These come as Common and Rare NFTs.

Notably, the crates are represented by ERC-20 tokens that will be burned once opened. However, this enables investors to actively trade the crates before they are opened, or simply hold onto them for future trading or opening.

The first week of the sale includes a 10% discount on crate purchases. Additionally, buyers will receive a 5% discount on every 5th crate purchased within a single tier and a 2.5% sale commission for referring other buyers.

The sale also features Apex-level cars, which are very rare and potentially high-valued. Each crate purchase earns the buyer one or more Apex Car Tickets, depending on the tier. These rare cars will be given away after 2,000 and 4,000 crates have been sold and at the end of the sale.
