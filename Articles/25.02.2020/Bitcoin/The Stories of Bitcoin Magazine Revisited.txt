TITLE: The Stories of Bitcoin Magazine Revisited

From 2012 to 2014, Bitcoin Magazine produced 22 print issues covering the burgeoning technology, its budding culture and potential impact.

This week, we’ve revisited some of those stories with updates, reflections and commentary.

And if you’re really astute, you’ll notice that we’ve been experimenting with the format of Bitcoin Magazine over the past few weeks. As part of our new year planning, we decided that we should really shift our focus more toward storytelling instead of primarily publishing news.

While we aren’t horrible at producing news, there are other sites with more reporters that already do a great job at serving that need for our readers. At some point, it all becomes noise if there’s no differentiation.

To help increase the depth of our stories, we’re doubling down on our non-written content to help support our stories in more formats. We now have multiple podcasts (Weekly Bits, Happy Hour, and our flagship Bitcoin Magazine Podcast) available on every major platform, plus we’re ramping up our video content on YouTube and Twitter.

If you’re interested in writing/podcasting/producing video with us, drop me a note at flip at bitcoinmagazine.com or on Twitter at @flip_btcmag. We’re actively wanting to hear from new voices in the ecosystem.

2020 will be a banner year for Bitcoin and there’s excitement in the air once again. As all of the precoiners rush to comprehend what is happening, we want to be a place for all of them to learn about the different aspects that reinforce how transformative Bitcoin will be to our lives. It’s not just about “number go up” and “orange coin good”; true hyperbitcoinization will change us in ways for which we are not prepared.
