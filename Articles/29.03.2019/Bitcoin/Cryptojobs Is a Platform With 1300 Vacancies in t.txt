1,300 Ads on a Crypto Job Board

Cryptojobs (crypto.jobs) is among the leading platforms specializing in posting new openings for those who wish to begin or continue their career in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. The website currently lists almost 1,300 jobs and adds new vacancies almost every day.

Users can filter the ads by categories, which include tech, design, business development, sales, marketing, operations, customer support, analyst, and other, as well as browse them by skills. They can also toggle between all jobs and remote positions, some of which are restricted to a particular territory.

Each job posting contains a description of the respective position and the specific requirements for the candidates. The ads also indicate if the job is a full-time or part-time engagement, a temporary contract or an internship.

Cryptojobs enables companies to post new jobs free of charge. A $199 paid upgrade provides them with unlimited applications, highlighted ads on the homepage, push notifications to subscribed candidates and other additional services. Job seekers can upload their resumes thanks to a recently added feature.
