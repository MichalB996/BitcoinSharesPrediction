From a bold call on the current state of the market to new adoption for XRP and Litecoin, here‚Äôs a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.

Bitcoin

The host of CNBC‚Äôs Crypto Trader triggered Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts around the world with a simple tweet, stating that we are now in a bull market.

We‚Äôre in a bull market. ‚Äî Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) March 27, 2019

NeuNer is no stranger to daring declarations and offered no further clarification on his statement, which led to a burst of memes in response.

Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow 7.8% range through the month of March. Cryptocurrency analyst Murad Mahmudov told MarketWatch the relatively low volatility could be a positive sign for the leading digital asset.

‚ÄúVolatility is in itself a neutral signal. Historically however, low-volatility periods in BTC have always preceded prolonged bull runs, especially after capitulation moments of high momentum as seen in November and December.‚Äù

Ripple and XRP

Ripple has released a speech from the director of Kapronasia, a financial technology research and consulting firm that focuses on the latest trends across Asia.

At Ripple Regionals 2019, Zennon Kapron talks about Asia‚Äôs digital payments transformation over the last 14 years and the impact payment companies like Ripple can have on the space.

Meanwhile, the Singapore-based crypto exchange Bitrue continues to add XRP pairs at a rapid rate. The exchange just added Zilliqa, Golem, IOST and Icon trading pairs, bringing the number of coins paired with XRP to 38.

Ethereum

Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin just gave an ask-me-anything on Reddit/EthTrader.

Buterin talks about his thoughts on the crypto and blockchain community at large, blockchain anonymity, Ethereum 2.0 and more.

Litecoin

The biggest car dealership in Oklahoma City, has officially started accepting Litecoin, in addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bob Moore Auto Group is using the merchant payment company Aliant Payments to process the transactions.

Stellar Lumens

Cryptocurrency research and analytics firm Messari is revealing new information on a little-known bug that hit Stellar Lumens (XLM) back in April of 2017.

A hacker used the vulnerability to create 2.25 billion XLM, which was worth about $10 million at the time. According to the report, it‚Äôs highly likely that the XLM was promptly sold on a number of crypto exchanges. Once it discovered the issue, the team at Stellar burned 2.25 billion XLM in order to ensure that the coin‚Äôs overall supply of just over 19 billion XLM would remain the same.

IOTA

The team at IOTA has released a new blog post outlining its efforts to bug test the official IOTA beta wallet dubbed Trinity.

Right now, the Trinity mobile and desktop apps are going through a third-party security audit to assess authentication, storage areas, configuration and validation to make sure the wallet is air tight.

Tron

As promised, Tron has handed a new Tesla to a follower who qualified for the giveaway on Twitter by following Tron founder Justin Sun and retweeting his post about the contest.
