Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin BTC every fucking day.

Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what‚Äôs been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Satoshi Nakamoto used to say: Your imagination is the only tool in the book!

Bitcoin Price

We closed the day, October 20 2019, at a price of $8,222. That‚Äôs a respectable 2.80 percent increase in 24 hours, or $224. It was the highest closing price in five days.

We‚Äôre still 59 percent below Bitcoin‚Äòs all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).

Bitcoin market cap

Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap ended the day at $148,026,597,064. It now commands 67 percent of the total crypto market.

Bitcoin volume

Yesterday‚Äôs volume of $15,504,249,442 was the highest in one day, 0 percent above the year‚Äôs average, and 65 percent below the year‚Äôs high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 324 tons of gold.

Bitcoin transactions

A total of 289,650 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 13 percent below the year‚Äôs average and 35 percent below the year‚Äôs high.

Bitcoin transaction fee

Yesterday‚Äôs average transaction fee concerned $0.11. That‚Äôs $3.60 below the year‚Äôs high of $3.71.

Bitcoin distribution by address

As of now, there are 12,040 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.6 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.5 percent, and the top 1000 34.4 percent.

Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin

With a market capitalization of $149 billion, PetroChina has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.

Bitcoin‚Äôs path towards $1 million

On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.

He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn‚Äôt. Unfortunately for him it‚Äôs 93.1 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‚Äòs price should have been $120,606 by now, according to dickline.info.

Bitcoin Energy Consumption

Bitcoin used an estimated 200 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 73 terawatt hour. That‚Äôs the equivalent of Austria‚Äôs energy consumption or 6,8 million US households. Bitcoin‚Äôs energy consumption now represents 0.3% of the whole world‚Äôs electricity use.

Bitcoin on Twitter

Yesterday 13,294 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That‚Äôs 28.6 percent below the year‚Äôs average. The maximum amount of tweets per day this year about Bitcoin was 41,687.
