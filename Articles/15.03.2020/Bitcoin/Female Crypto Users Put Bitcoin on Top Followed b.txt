A new 10-month study by 2gether, a crypto platform that aims to replace traditional banking, reveals the profile of female cryptocurrency users. The company conducted its survey from April 2019 to February 2020, polling 5,000 female users of the platform from Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and 19 Eurozone countries.

The poll reveals that female traders heavily trade Bitcoin and Ethereum. BTC and ETH represent 64% and 22% of the total trading volume, respectively.

While female crypto users also dabble in large-cap coins such as Bitcoin Cash, EOS and Cardano, these coins have captured less than 4% of the total trading volume.

The survey also shows that women account for 23% of all cryptocurrency users, slightly up from a study conducted in 2019 by fintech firm BitPanda, which showed that 22% of crypto holders in Europe were female versus 78% male.
