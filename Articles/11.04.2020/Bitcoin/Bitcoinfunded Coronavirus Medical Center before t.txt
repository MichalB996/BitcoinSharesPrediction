Bitcoin helps victims of coronavirus in Italy

Most of the time, they are completely ignored for no apparent reason.

In Italy, the coronavirus outbreak was slightly different.

The Red Cross ran a fundraising campaign for portable medical mail prior to triage.

One of the payment methods was Bitcoin, which immediately attracted a lot of attention.

After successful financing of the campaign, the pre-triage tent for coronavirus cases is located now fully functional.

It is located near Rome and is operated jointly by the Italian Red Cross.

It is the first time that Bitcoin has played such a prominent role during the coronavirus crisis.

One can only hope that in the near future more charities will bet on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Overall, this news is very positive for the Bitcoin community.

It brings positive attention to an industry that is often criticized and questioned for no apparent reason.

As this example clearly shows, the modern form of money should never be ignored.
