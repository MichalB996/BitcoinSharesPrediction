Jack Dorsey’s Cash App will be opening itself up for users to take in stimulus funds provided by the recent CARES act put in place by the United States government. This, of course, is an act put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic putting tens and millions out of work.

To help out, the Twitter CEO’s app can double as a bank account for this stimulus package to be deposited into. According to an excerpt from the company’s blog, these can be found in a Banking tab within the app:

“Cash App now offers account and routing numbers that you can use to deposit your stimulus payment directly to your Cash App balance. To find them, tap the Banking tab on the bottom left of your Cash App home screen. If you don’t see them, you can get them by activating your free Cash Card.”

Dorsey is a massive fan of Bitcoin and believes it is to be the currency of the internet. Cash App is meant to be a simple place for users to buy and sell the asset, hopefully increasing adoption. His company is also going all-in on the Lightning Network – an underlying technology that would increase scalability on the Bitcoin blockchain.
