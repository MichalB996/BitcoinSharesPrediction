Despite a Twitter shadowban, purportedly for its Covid-19 coverage, Messari presses on with new ways to analyze how the pandemic might be influencing markets.

Today, Messari announced new Covid-19 charting features that allow users to simultaneously chart how assets perform amidst the pandemic, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, stocks and indexes, precious metals, crude oil, and even uranium. In the chart search bar, users are able to pick an option called “Covid V Markets,” and pick which assets and classes they want to overlay and analyze with Covid-19 data.

The company said the data is sourced from eodhistoricaldata.com and is limited to daily intervals. The data on Covid-19 allows users to chart the number of cases and deaths worldwide, and country by country, like how the US surpassed Italy in total reported cases.

As an example of insights users could glean from the new data sets, Messari CEO Ryan Selkis pointed to how BTC outperformed the S&P 500 “up until the corona induced carnage,” and has continued to perform better since. Other data shows how Litecoin has reacted similarly to gold.

This latest announcement comes after Selkis and Messari said they were being “shadowbanned” and massively reported on Twitter last week for their coverage of the pandemic.

With the latest features, Messari users are now able to make their own judgments on how the epidemic is affecting markets.
