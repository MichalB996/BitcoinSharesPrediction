Reading Time: < 1 minute

IN THIS “LOCKDOWN EDITION”, James and Graeme video call each other and discuss the crazy rebound in traditional markets, they discuss the strength of the US Dollar in these times, and then of course look at the Bitcoin price in light of the current (and depressing) economic climate.

It’s looking extremely interesting out there, so take it easy. Keep an eye on our Whatsapp and Telegram groups to see what the rest of the community are seeing in the charts.
