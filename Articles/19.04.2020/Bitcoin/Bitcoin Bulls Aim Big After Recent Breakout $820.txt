Bitcoin is Gaining Momentum

This past week, bitcoin regained strength after trading to a new weekly low at $6,482 against the US Dollar. BTC price traded higher steadily and surpassed the $6,800 resistance area.

The bulls managed to lead the price above the main $7,000 resistance area and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). The price even climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last key decline from the $7,470 high to $6,482 low.

More importantly, was a break above a major declining channel with resistance near $7,040 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price is now trading nicely above the $7,200 pivot level.

It is testing the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last key decline from the $7,470 high to $6,482 low. Therefore, there are high chances of more gains above the $7,300 and $7,400 levels.

An initial resistance is near the $7,500 level, above which the price is likely to accelerate higher. The next key hurdles on the upside are near the $8,000 level. Any further upsides might call for a test of the $8,200 level.

Downside Correction

If bitcoin fails to continue higher or struggles to clear the $7,500 resistance, then it could start a downside correction in the near term. An initial support is near the $7,050 level.

The first major support is near the $6,960 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). Any further losses may perhaps lead the price back towards the $6,500 support area.
