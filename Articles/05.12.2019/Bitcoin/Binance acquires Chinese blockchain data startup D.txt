In the near future, Trust Wallet will integrate DappReview APIs to provide easy access to explore new dapps and crypto games, as well as more insight into DeFi [decentralized finance] services, analytics and usage.”

As per a statement from Binance, in return, Binance will offer support for DappReview in non-technical fields, including marketing and business development while the platform maintains its independence in technical development and operations. Vincent Niu, founder of DappReview said: “By working with Binance X [the company’s developer network] and Launchpad, DappReview will bring in more talented Dapp developers and assist promising Dapp projects on fund-raising. DappReview will partner with the public chains and protocols in the Dapp space through Binance’s ecosystem.”

One of Binance’s more recent funding rounds was through Dapix, a Colorado-based blockchain company has announced that it has raised £4.63m in a recently held series A funding round led by Binance Labs. David Gold, Dapix founder and CEO in a statement said: “The Internet was around for more than 10 years before a key usability protocol enabled usage to explode. Our goal is nothing less than to have the decentralised FIO Protocol enable a similar outcome for the blockchain ecosystem.”
