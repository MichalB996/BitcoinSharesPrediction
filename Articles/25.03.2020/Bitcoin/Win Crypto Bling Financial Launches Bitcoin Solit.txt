Bling Financial, a Bitcoin rewards platform, has partnered with PlayDay Studios, a developer of mobile apps and games. In a world of social distancing, Bling said it is anticipating an increasing interest from game developers looking to attract more users.

Bling has created mobile games that enable users to earn free Bitcoin. This newest partnership allows PlayDay Studios to leverage the Bling Platform’s technology, and allow additional users to earn free Bitcoin via Bitcoin Solitaire.

Bling’s CTO, Dan Rice says that with a just few lines of code a game developer can create a strong incentive for new users to try their game.

playBling Financial CEO Amy Wan, a well-known name in the Fintech world, said they rushed to help PlayDay Studios into the market given the events of the past few weeks and the COVID-19 crisis:

“With folks increasingly staying home, we think it’s an important time to enable game developers to launch games that allow users to earn Bitcoin rewards and developers to acquire new users.”

Bling views the relationship with PlayDay and other game studios as a symbiotic relationship and mutually beneficial.

Bling Financial was founded in 2017 seeking to reinvent people’s relationships with money. The Bling platform provides developers a reward platform and technology to acquire new users and monetize their games.
