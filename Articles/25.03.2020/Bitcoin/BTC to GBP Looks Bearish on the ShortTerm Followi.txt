UK CPI Tops Forecasts

While it may not be as pronounced as the price action on GBPUSD, the recent UK inflation data is helping the pound find bids against bitcoin price. The BTC to GBP exchange rate looks bearish on the 1-hour time frame after CPI data for February topped forecasts. As reported by the Office for National Statistics today, the headline CPI figure for February posted a 1.7% uptick compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, the core inflation figure topped the 1.5% consensus when it came in at 1.7%.

Better-than-expected inflation reports tend to have a bullish effect on currencies. This is because higher inflationary pressures tend to make central bankers more hawkish or more inclined to tighten monetary policy.
