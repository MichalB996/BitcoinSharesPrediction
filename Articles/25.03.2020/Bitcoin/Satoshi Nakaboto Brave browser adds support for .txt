Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin BTC every fucking day.

Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you whatâ€™s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Foucault used to say: Buy low, sell high!

Bitcoin price

We closed the day, March 24 2020, at a price of $6,734. Thatâ€™s a respectable 4.63 percent increase in 24 hours, or $298. It was the highest closing price in twelve days.

Weâ€™re still 66 percent below Bitcoinâ€˜s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).

Bitcoin market cap

Bitcoinâ€™s market cap ended the day at $123,148,917,787. It now commands 67 percent of the total crypto market.

Bitcoin volume

Yesterdayâ€™s volume of $48,221,910,672 was the highest in three days, 136 percent above last yearâ€™s average, and 34 percent below last yearâ€™s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 930 tons of gold.

Bitcoin transactions

A total of 277,999 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 14 percent below last yearâ€™s average and 38 percent below last yearâ€™s high.

Bitcoin transaction fee

Yesterdayâ€™s average transaction fee concerned $0.62. Thatâ€™s $3.09 below last yearâ€™s high of $3.71.

Bitcoin distribution by address

As of now, there are 10,295 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.7 percent of the total supply, the top 100 15.2 percent, and the top 1000 35.2 percent.

Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin

With a market capitalization of $122 billion, Abbott Laboratories has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.

Bitcoinâ€™s path towards $1 million

On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.

He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesnâ€™t. Unfortunately for him itâ€™s 97.3 percent behind being on track. Bitcoinâ€˜s price should have been $256,184 by now, according to dickline.info.

Bitcoin Energy Consumption

Bitcoin used an estimated 189 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 69 terawatt hour. Thatâ€™s the equivalent of Czech Republicâ€™s energy consumption or 6,4 million US households. Bitcoinâ€™s energy consumption now represents 0.3% of the whole worldâ€™s electricity use.

Bitcoin on Twitter

Yesterday 31,076 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. Thatâ€™s 67.1 percent above last yearâ€™s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day last year about Bitcoin was 75,543.
