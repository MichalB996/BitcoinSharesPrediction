The crypto market has taken an opposite turn in today’s financial trading trade. Bitcoin is again on the critical price of $6.5k and looking to break below it. ETH is also suffering heavy price corrections again with the levels dipping to $130.

Just when the crypto market was building overall sustainable bullish momentum, the bears surprised the majority of the crypto assets.

The overall market capitalization is $185,269,841,028 and volume traded is $142,007,604,985. The overall dominance of BTC remains at 65%.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis

Bitcoin is having a roller-coaster price movement since yesterday. The world’s largest cryptoasset provided some relief to the crypto investors by crossing the crucial price level of $6.5. It also looked strong to break another crucial level of $7k. However, the resistance of $6900 came in between and put a halt on the bullish move. Since then, BTC has been a victim of bearish move again in the market. It is now again looking to break below $6.5k which is certainly not a good sign. The current price is $6629.03 with the market cap of $121,153,781,035,150 and volume traded of $46,510,350,985. The cryptoasset may find the support level of $6500 and $6200 if the bears are not that impactful.
