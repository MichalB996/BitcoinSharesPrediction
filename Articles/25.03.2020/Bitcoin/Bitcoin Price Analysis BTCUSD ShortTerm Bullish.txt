Bitcoin has formed higher lows and higher highs to trade inside a rising channel on its 1-hour chart. Price is testing the mid-channel area of interest and a break higher could clear the path for a move to the top.

The 100 SMA is above the 200 SMA to suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside or that the climb is more likely to gain traction from here. These moving averages are also close to the channel bottom to add to its strength as support.

However, RSI is pointing down to signal the presence of bearish pressure and the oscillator has ground to cover before reflecting oversold conditions. Stochastic is just turning lower and about to cross the center line, so selling pressure might still pick up. In that case, another test of the channel bottom could take place.

Bitcoin has been trailing risk assets like stocks these days as it attempts to benefit from the pickup in overall sentiment. Much of the attention is on the stimulus efforts being unveiled by central banks and governments in hopes of limiting the impact of the coronavirus crisis on their respective economies.

Cryptocurrencies might still be able to edge out the competition in the event of a credit or cash crunch, though, as these could retain value and enjoy stronger demand even if traditional assets tumble again. Also, keep in mind that the bitcoin halving is approaching in a couple of months and investors might want to position ahead of a potential doubling or even tripling of value in the long run.

For now, bitcoin is also taking advantage of dollar weakness as traders are starting to ease their long positions, possibly gearing up for more risk rallies or a massive unwinding.
