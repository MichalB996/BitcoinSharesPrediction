Wowoo Exchange Singapore (WES), a cryptocurrency trading platform, announced recently that it will halt operations. The exchange company launched the business back in June 2019.

WES offered Singapore dollar trading on bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) along with a BTC/ETH market.

“The management of Wowoo Exchange Singapore (WES) is sad to announce that due to strategic realignment, WES will be halting operations in Singapore with immediate effect. All users can be assured that all assets in their WES accounts are safe and being held securely. Users are asked to withdraw all their assets from the WES platform by March 30th, 2020 at the latest. All Wowoo Exchange fees will be waived until this date.”
