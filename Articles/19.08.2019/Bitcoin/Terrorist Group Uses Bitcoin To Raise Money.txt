Hamas, the militant Palestinian group, has come up with a new way to raise funds for its terror campaigns: bitcoin.

The New York Times reported that the latest version of a website set up by the groupâ€™s military wing, known as the Qassam Brigades, provides every visitor with a unique bitcoin address to allow them to send the digital currency so that the donations are nearly impossible for law enforcement to trace.

The site is available in seven languages and also features a video that explains how to acquire and send the digital currency without authorities catching on.
