Earlier this month, IDEO CoLab announced the launch of its new Startup Studio program to help accelerate blockchain entrepreneurs and startups, in partnership with over 20 leading organizations and protocols and 50+ world-class mentors.

Today, IDEO has announced a global online hackathon in partnership with CoinList and the foundations and development teams of five leading blockchain protocols: Ethereum, NEAR, Oasis, Stellar, and Tezos.

The online hackathon will run from August 5th through September 22nd. Teams will be expected to ship a functional version of their project by September 9th and spend the last 2 weeks getting adoption and demonstrating traction.

“Teams are welcome to focus on any area that excites them — from finance to gaming, social media to marketplaces. We’re most interested in applications with the potential to greatly expand the number of people that interact with crypto and blockchain-based applications…”

– Dan Elitzer, Investor IDEO CoLab Ventures

The grand prize includes $10,000 and an invitation to become an IDEO CoLab resident. The runner up receives $5,000, and protocol winners (one for each protocol) receive $2,000, plus other benefits.
