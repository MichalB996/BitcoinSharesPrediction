Ring in the new bitcoin halving cycle the right way: with us!

Bitcoin Magazine presents non-stop coverage of Bitcoin’s third Halving with hours of commentary and analysis from Bitcoin 2020 speakers and some of our closest friends.

The Halving (sometimes referred to as “ the Halvening ”) is the predetermined moment when Bitcoin’s block subsidy gets cut in half. The halving of Bitcoin’s block subsidy occurs every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years) and is a key feature of Bitcoin.

Online poker site Americas Cardroom (ACR) now holds the Guinness World Record for largest cryptocurrency jackpot in an online poker tournament.

The site made a $1,050,560 payout in bitcoin to the winner of its online competition. ACR first published the news on its Twitter page on Wednesday, July 25, 2019.

The winner, Brazilian online poker player Rafael “TheBigKid” Moraes, emerged victorious in a three-day $2,500 plus $150 buy-in tournament. Moraes reportedly beat runner-up “GinkgoBiloba” to the title. As the second runner-up, GinkgoBiloba was rewarded with $760,794 in prize money.

The tournament was the first multi-day event hosted by ACR. At one point, the prize money had to be increased to $6,382,500 as the number of players grew.

After the payout, Guinness World Records awarded Winning Poker Network (WPN) and ACR, its flagship site, the new record for the largest cryptocurrency jackpot ever in an online poker tournament.

Poker news outlet HighstakesDB quoted WPN spokesperson Michael Harris, who said, “Earning the Guinness World Record title means it wasn’t just an online poker tournament, it was history in the making.”

ACR has been accepting bitcoin since its early days in 2015 and now pulls in 60 percent revenue from cryptocurrencies alone, according to the news outlet.
