YourBitStore.com has announced the opening of two bitcoin ATM locations in Orange County, California, where people can convert cash into the cryptocurrency of their choice, including bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple and EOS.

The machines also allow users to sell their cryptocurrency and get cash on the spot, according to a press release.

YourBitStore plans to open 30 additional ATMs in California over the next two years, the release said.

YourBitStore.com two-way bitcoin ATMs allow users to buy or sell cryptocurrencies on the spot paying with cash for purchases or receiving cash for sales, the company said.

"Cryptocurrencies were created to give people back their privacy in regards to their money, so it defeats the object if the only way to buy or sell cryptocurrency is to link it with a bank account from a centralized financial institution," YourBitStore.com owner Raffi King said in the release.

The company also is working on a prepaid cryptocurrency gift card that it hopes to have it ready by the end of the summer, the release said.
