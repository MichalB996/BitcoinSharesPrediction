Year-to-date, Bitcoin is more than double its price. However, much more was expected from price action given how stellar the performance was in the first half of what is turning to be a mixed year. Going into 2020, experts together with supportive data drawn from Deribit, a cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform, the upcoming year could offer more opportunities judging from the overwhelming number of Bitcoin Call Options. In the last 24 hours alone, they have experienced “by far the most volume.” Pointers, this may after all be a positive indicator of what lies ahead.

Taking to Twitter, Deribit observed that the lowest strike price for Bitcoin going into the 2020 as per the earliest expiring Call Option is $7,500. The Option expires on Jan 3, 2020.

The other two strike prices expire on Mar 27. The most traded, attracting 3.77 million contracts, has a strike price of $9,000 a pop, while the second most attractive Call option, with a strike price of $10,000, had 3.75 million contracts.

A “Call Option” is the right but not an obligation to buy the underlying asset, in this case, Bitcoin, at a pre-determined price, the Strike Price, within a specific period.

The Deribit Index is composed of BTC-USD spot rates from six leading exchanges, including Bitstamp and ItBit. Every 6 seconds, the index is updated by averaging the bid-spread price to mitigate impacts related to flash crashes or short squeezes prevalent in crypto exchanges.

Overly, crypto analysts and market influencers are upbeat going into the halving year. Mike Novogratz, the founder of Galaxy Digital, said Bitcoin could rise to $12,000 in 2020.
