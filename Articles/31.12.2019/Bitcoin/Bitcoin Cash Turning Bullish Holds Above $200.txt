Bitcoin Cash is showing bullish bias as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency continues to firm above the technically important $200 level.

Technical analysis highlights that if bulls can rally the cryptocurrency above the $225 level, then the BCH/USD pair could continue its advance towards the $280 level.The BCH/USD pair has staged a strong recovery from the worst levels of the month, with the cryptocurrency gaining over 25% since Dec. 18.

At current levels, Bitcoin Cash looks to close the month of December basically flat, although it will finish 2019 with a gain of just under 35%.

The four-hour time frame shows that the BCH/USD pair has turned technically bullish for the first time since mid-November. Furthermore, a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern will form if bulls can rally price towards the $225 level.

The size of the pattern suggests that the BCH/USD could rally towards the $270 level if bulls ignite the bullish pattern. The daily time frame shows that short and medium-term analysis is aligning well, with major trendline resistance located around the $225.

Looking more closely at the daily time frame, major upsloping trendline resistance, and the BCH/USD pairâ€™s 200-day moving average, is offering dual resistance around the $280 level. Technical indicators are also turning bullish over the medium-term, with the Relative Strength Index now offering a strong buy signal.

Upside Potential

The four-hour time frame shows that key technical resistance is now located at the $215 and $225 levels. Key technical resistance over the medium-term is located at the $270 and $280 levels.

Downside Potential

The four-hour time frame is showing that the BCH/USD pair has strong long-term technical support around the $200 and $190 levels.

A reversal from current levels and sustained weakness under the $170 level will leave the BCH/USD pair exposed to additional losses towards the $150 level.

Summary

Bitcoin cash has staged an impressive reversal from the worst levels of December, with bulls now targeting the $225 level. Overall, a breakout above the $225 level should confirm a major upside rally towards the $270 to $280 technical region.
