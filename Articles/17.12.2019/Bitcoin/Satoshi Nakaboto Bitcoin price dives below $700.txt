Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin BTC every fucking day.

Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Jane Didion used to say: Crack open this tasty lobster!

Bitcoin Price

We closed the day, December 16 2019, at a price of $6,932. That’s a notable 3.09 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$221.18. It was the lowest closing price in two hundred and nineteen days.

We’re still 65 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).

Bitcoin market cap

Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $125,515,586,952. It now commands 68 percent of the total crypto market.

Bitcoin volume

Yesterday’s volume of $20,213,265,950 was the highest in eleven days, 22 percent above the year’s average, and 55 percent below the year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 425 tons of gold.

Bitcoin transactions

A total of 326,928 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 0 percent below the year’s average and 27 percent below the year’s high.

Bitcoin transaction fee

Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.18. That’s $3.53 below the year’s high of $3.71.

Bitcoin distribution by address

As of now, there are 10,873 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.7 percent of the total supply, the top 100 15.1 percent, and the top 1000 34.9 percent.

Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin

With a market capitalization of $126 Billion, AstraZeneca has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.

Bitcoin’s path towards $1 million

On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.

He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 95.6 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $158,824 by now, according to dickline.info.

Yesterday 18,724 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 2.1 percent above the year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day this year about Bitcoin was 41,687.
