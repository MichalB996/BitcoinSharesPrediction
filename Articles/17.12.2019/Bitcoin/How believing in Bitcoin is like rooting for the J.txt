Being a Bitcoin fan is just like rooting for the Jets.

There was that time when you had to listen to a guy at a party talking up cryptocurrency, when it traded at $20,000 and he was making money or his friend had. That golden era, two years ago, might go down as the cryptocurrency world’s equivalent of the Jets' Super Bowl III victory.

And yet! Did you know Bitcoin nearly doubled in value this year? It’s true. It beat out the stock market and almost anything else you could buy with fiat currency.

Mind you, you had to act fast to catch the rally. It started the first week in January at $4,000; by June a Bitcoin was worth more than $12,000, thanks to excitement driven by the looming arrival of Facebook’s Libra currency, which surely would bring more legitimacy to the market. When it became clear Mark Zuckerberg couldn’t create a digital central bank just because he wanted to, Bitcoin gave up nearly two-thirds of its run-up. It’s trading at less than $7,000 per coin now.
