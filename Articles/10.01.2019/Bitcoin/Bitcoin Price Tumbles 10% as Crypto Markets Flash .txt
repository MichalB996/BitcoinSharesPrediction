The price of bitcoin fell more than 10 percent during Thursday’s trading session as the cryptocurrency erased a large portion of its recent gains.

At 6:00 UTC, bitcoin opened the trading hour at a price of $4,018, but fell to $3,748 before the hour was complete. After trading sideways until 16:00 UTC, the sell-off accelerated to a low of $3,570, according to CoinDesk pricing data.

Bitcoin’s current price of $3,610 reflects a $367 difference and more than 9 percent drop from its 24-hour opening price of $3,995, CoinDesk data further reveals.

In the last 24-hours, a total of $6.4 billion of bitcoin was traded across exchanges as its total market capitalization fell roughly 7 percent from $70 billion to $64 billion.

The broader market has accompanied bitcoin in its latest dip as it usually does when bitcoin markets show weakness.

According to Coindesk’s Crypto-Economic Explorer (CEX), 18 of the 19 tracked cryptocurrencies are reporting double-digit 24-hour losses, with several extending depreciation beyond 15 percent including litecoin (LTC), neo (NEO) and cardano (ADA).

Cardano is the worst performers today, currently printing an 18 percent loss. As it stands, the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market is registering $122 billion, down 10.2 percent on the day according to CoinMarketCap.
