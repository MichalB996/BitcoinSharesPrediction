Bitcoin ATM firm Bitstop announced on Thursday it has partnered with KIOSK Information Systems (KIOSK), a custom self-service solution provider, to create an innovative Bitcoin ATM platform enabling customers to easily buy and sell digital currency on the spot. While sharing details about the partnership, Bill Butler, KIOSK CEO, stated:

“We’re excited to partner with Bitstop on this Bitcoin ATM solution. They have a great reputation in the Bitcoin space and are one of the premier operators in the Crypto ATM industry.”

Andrew Barnard, Bitstop’s Co-Founder, also commented:

“Our goal is to sell thousands of Bitcoin ATMs globally over the next few years. While the market is currently still in its infancy, we predict that within five years, it will be normal to see a Bitcoin ATM when you’re out shopping, traveling or pumping gas. To get to that point, we know it must be incredibly easy for the consumer to use, and for the retailer to operate.”
