Summary

Bitcoin recently dropped by 20% following Fed Chair Powell's "negative" remarks about Libra.

Yet, bitcoin's bull market started well before anything about Libra was announced, and it is likely to continue going forward.

Yes, corporate-backed coins like Libra would likely expedite the process of bringing the two worlds of crypto and fiats into one ecosystem.

However, this is not necessary for bitcoin and other systemically important digital assets to succeed and to continue to appreciate long term.

We are still very early in the digitization and tokenization process of the financial system, and bitcoin is likely to play a central role as the process proceeds going forward.
