FXCM Group has released a comprehensive execution quality report for the ‎one-month period ending on January 31, 2019, detailing average ‎spreads and slippage metrics on its ‘Active Trader’ trading accounts.‎

Slippage is the difference between the quoted prices and those at which the ‎client’s orders have been executed by the broker. The less slippage the ‎trader gets, the better his trading results will be. ‎

According to figures stated in the report, the average spreads on the ‎EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD and XAU/USD pairs were 0.3, 0.3, ‎‎0.7 and 35.4 pips respectively. For the cryptocurrency pairs, the ‎company averaged 26.9 pips on BTC/USD and 2.0 on the Ethereum instrument, ETH/USD‏.‏

FXCM Group has recently expanded its range of cryptocurrency instruments and now offers CFDs on the second most popular coin, Ethereum, for all of its trading accounts.
