A Saudi Arabia-raised rapper and Oxford University graduate has said those who failed to buy Bitcoin at $6,000 would have no choice than to do so at $20,000.

Zuby, a United Kingdom-based rapper, said those who think Bitcoin was dead at $6,000 will crave for the digital currency when it reaches $20,000.

Bringing in the fact that humans are not rational, he said every time the price of the digital currency drops, people implore him to sell and completely get rid of his holdings.

The musician happy said he has the mind of hodling for over five years not minding any form of fluctuations.

He said: “The same people who think bitcoin is ‘dead’ at $6,000 will want to buy it when it reaches $20,000 again… Because humans beings are not rational.”

“Every time the price drops, people ask me if I sold and talk about ‘I told you so! Hope you got out’. They’re tripping. My time horizon for this is 5+ years. Fluctuations are irrelevant to me.”

Zuby, like other important personalities who see a future in cryptocurrency, is determined to keep his cryptocurrency holding until there is a meaningful increase in value.

Yesterday, NewsLogical quoted the bestselling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, 72 years old Robert Kiyosaki, on the present crypto market situation.

Robert Kiyosaki enjoined people to buy Bitcoin, gold, and silver this period as government shares palliatives on COVID-19.

The entrepreneur author foresaw the death of the US Dollars, therefore, encouraging people to buy Bitcoin as a key alternative.
