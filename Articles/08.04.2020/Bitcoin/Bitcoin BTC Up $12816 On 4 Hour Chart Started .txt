From theRealKiyosaki :

WHY IS DOLLAR DYING? 2008 Fed printed $4.5 Trillion to save rich. 2020 Fed will have to print $6-8 Trillion, maybe more to save US economy. There is only $9.5 Trillion in gold in WHOLE WORLD. Buy real gold silver Bitcoin. No paper ETF gold or silver. PhDs at Fed are IDIOTS.

The same people who think bitcoin is ‘dead’ at $6,000 will want to buy it when it reaches $20,000 again…Because humans beings are not rational.

Bitcoin went from $0 to $20k with no central bank, market makers, or buy-in from institutions. Just HODLers. Unwavering hands.

Unstoppable belief.
