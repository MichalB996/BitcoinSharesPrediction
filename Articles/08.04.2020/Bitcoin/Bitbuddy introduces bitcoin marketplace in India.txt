“Other inexpensive crypto currencies may not be that good, which means investor end up losing money.However, we believe that nobody should put more than 5 percent of their total portfolio in this cryptocurrency. And, it should be bought always for long term,” he added.

Bitbuddy is available on Play Store as well as App store.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) barred cryptocurrency trading in 2018, highlighting the inherent risks involved and likened it to a Ponzi scheme.

The Supreme Court of India lifted the ban on crypto trading after crypto exchanges, startups, and industry bodies challenged the decision.

The RBI is planning to file a review petition in the Supreme Court against the latter’s decision to reject the ban.
