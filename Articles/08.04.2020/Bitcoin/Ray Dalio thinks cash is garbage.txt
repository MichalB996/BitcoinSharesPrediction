Ray Dalio, who founded Bridgewater Associates in 1985, has become one of the most famous names in the investment world over time. We also know Dalio, who generally makes statements about gold and stock markets, with his comments about Bitcoin. Although he doesn’t like Bitcoin very much, there is something he likes less than Bitcoin: Cash money.

Garbage Simulation

The US billionaire recently organized an AMA (ask me anything) on ​​Reddit and evaluated current economic developments. Reminding that central banks continue to print money, Dalio said that it is not logical to hold cash at the moment and suggested that people turn to products such as gold. Dalio also stated that cash is currently “garbage” next to products such as gold:

“The value of cash doesn’t change as much as other products. But please note that the return of money to you will decrease over time. That’s why I think money is garbage amongst other products. Especially products such as gold, which can maintain their value even in periods of inflation. ”

Not so important

In his responses to the questions posed to him, Dalio also explained his views on money. According to Dalio, people pay more attention to things like health, family and basic needs than money.

According to Dalio, all this means that money is not as important as it is actually supposed to be or is shown. In his view, this shows that the internal value of money is not as obvious as it is supposed to be:

“I thought a lot about the value of money and I believe that money doesn’t actually have an intrinsic value… Our current behavior will determine the future of our society. We have enough wealth to meet the basic needs of most people. If we use it well, we can increase the productivity of the society. ”
