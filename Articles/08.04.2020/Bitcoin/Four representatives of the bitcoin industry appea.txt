Four representatives of the crypto industry have been in the new Forbes rating of billionaires.

At the head of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, whose belongings are valued at $ 113 billion, adopted by Microsoft founder ($ 98 billion), French businessman Bernard Arnault ($ 76 billion) and 89-year-old Bitcoin investor and critic Warren Buffett ($ 67.5 billion).

Four representatives of the crypto industry acquired into the rating with 2095 billionaires:

co-founders of the Chinese language mining large Bitmain Mikri Zhang ($ 3.2 billion) and Cihan Wu ($ 1.eight billion);

Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen ($ 2.6 billion);

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong ($ 1 billion).

It's noteworthy that the record didn't embrace ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin and CEO of Binance Trade Changpen Zhao, who in 2018 have been in the rating of the richest representatives of the crypto industry. Then the state of Lubin was estimated at $ 1-5 billion, and Zhao - at $ 1.1-2 billion.

Recall that earlier, Forbes offered a listing of 50 firms actively utilizing blockchain.
