Draymond Green and The Warriors have agreed to a four year and $100M extension, Green was set to hit free agency next summer because of the contract deadline.

Green’s deal, which starts during the 20/21 season, brings his contract in total to 4 + 1 year, $118. Green is an overall three-time All Star and hewill make $22M, $24M, $25M and $27M over the course of the contract extension.

Surprisingly Daymond Green agreed to those terms – since he would have been eligible for a 5 year, $200M+ deal next summer from warriors, or four years, $151M from another team. The reason he was agreeing to the 4 years deal from Warriors 1 year ahead is, that many Players including current teammate Klay Thompson experienced injury in the year of ending contract just before joining a free agency. This act was the act for long term security and to minimize the possible injury impact on financial status.

Green, age 29, had a down year in his playing statistics in 18-19, averaging 7.3 points, 7.2 rebounds and 6.8 assists for the Warriors accross 66 games. Green’s 7.3 PPG is his lowest average of total of scores since his NBA season in 13/14.

However, Green who was titeled a Best Defensive Player of the Year remained a very effective player for Golden State Warriors, as he was helping the organization reach its 5th NBA Finals. He was playing very well in postseason averaging 13.2 points, 8.5 assists and 10.2 in 22 games.
