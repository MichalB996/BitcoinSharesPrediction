(Kitco News) Bitcoin tumbled to $7,100 after low levels triggered a technical selloff amid reports that China stepped up its crackdown on cryptos.

The cryptocurrency was last trading at $7,135.20, down 6.99% on the day, according to Kitco’s aggregated charts.

“The near-term technical chart posture for Bitcoin has become more bearish recently, amid a strengthening price downtrend in place on the daily chart. That is likely prompting keener selling interest,” Kitco’s senior technical analyst Jim Wyckoff wrote on Thursday.

Also, reports of China possibly cracking down on most popular crypto changes might have contributed to the speed of the selloff, Wyckoff added. “[China] has reportedly taken steps to curb crypto trading despite recently saying it may start to use the blockchain technology more,” he said.

Crypto markets were dragged lower after news that Chinese authorities reportedly raided Binance’s Shanghai offices. The report first appeared in The Block, which cited unnamed sources.

The news quickly spread across the crypto world but many questioned the information.

Binance spokekesperson denied reports of a police raid in an email to Kitco News. "Rumors of a police raid are false," the spokesperson said.
