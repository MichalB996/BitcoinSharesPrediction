HaasOnline - Create Crypto Algorithms Without Coding

HaasOnline Software, the creators of advanced crypto trading products, has announced the release of a Visual Editor, which leverages their overhauled scripting language, HaasScript. Users can choose between the newly released drag-and-drop visual editor or use the updated text-based editor while developing complex scripts to use with HaasOnline Trade Server.

Their powerful visual editor allows for an efficient way to organize and edit command blocks that make up the logic of how a specific script will execute. The visual designer is immensely helpful for users who have minimal programming experience but are looking to maximize their trade automation with a feature-rich scripting language. Users can switch to the text-based editor with IntelliSense to control exactly what’s going on under the hood of their scripts. All of this new functionality is made possible by using the growing library of over five hundred built-in and user-created commands that run on the latest version of HaasScript.

“With the introduction of the Visual Editor, which utilizes HaasScript, we have made it easy for users who don’t code to create scripts. We are happy with the feedback we have been receiving from the community.” said Quintus de Haas, HaasOnline’s chief technology officer. “Our development team has been working extremely hard to create and refine the world’s most advanced scripting language and tools for crypto automation.”

This latest string of releases is just the start of the next wave of innovations coming from HaasOnline Software. Upcoming releases will include a community marketplace for users to exchange custom technical indicators and automated trading strategies that are created with HaasScript. In addition, users will be able to subscribe to third-party signal providers.
