The South African Embassy in Egypt is currently working with emergency officials in an attempt to find out if any South Africans were involved in a bus explosion near Cairo. A tourist bus exploded on route to the Giza pyramids – injuring at least 12 people.

The Department of International Relations says that Ambassador Vusi Mavimbela and his team are engaging authorities to find out the nationalities of the victims.

The diplomatic team is also visiting hospitals in efforts to verify if any of the injured are locals. The Department has urged relatives of persons currently in Egypt to call the 24-hour call centre if they want to verify if their loved ones are affected.

The number to call is 012 351 1000. Dirco says the Embassy will send a report on their findings to Pretoria as soon as possible.
