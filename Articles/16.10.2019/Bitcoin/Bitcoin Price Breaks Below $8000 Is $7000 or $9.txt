This morning, Bitcoin price briefly broke back below $8,000 and is currently teetering on the support line – which could possibly be the last stand for bulls in this range before new lows are reached.

But all is not lost for bulls, and if Bitcoin buyers can push the price of the leading crypto asset up past a key resistance level, the bull market could be back on. If not, falling even deeper to find new support will be the end result.

Bitcoin Price: Bear Flag Could Bring Crypto Asset to $7,000 Unless Bulls Reclaim $9,000

Following Bitcoin’s bear market bottom, FOMO helped carry the price of Bitcoin to $14,000 bringing investors at the high an up to 350% gain. But once the leading crypto by market cap got there and couldn’t push through to a new all-time high, the buying momentum fizzled out, and interest has all but faded from the crypto market.

This can be seen by significant declines in trading volume, and through falling asset prices. After making a rally towards $9,000, Bitcoin price was stopped short and rejected hard at roughly $8,800, which sent the price of the first-ever cryptocurrency plummeting back down toward $8,000.

This morning, Bitcoin momentarily broke below $8,000 and is now trading at the critical support level. If breached, bears could push the price of Bitcoin down to support levels below.

Bitcoin appears to be consolidating within a bear flag on its daily price charts, and if confirmed, could spell disaster for bullish crypto investors. Downside targets below current prices range from $6,800 to $7,400 as the next zone where a bounce most likely could occur and a new trading range be established. If not, the February 2018 low of $5,800 could be tested.

In the chart below, the bearish scenario shows Bitcoin falling from the bear flag formation to the aforementioned support levels.

Also depicted, is a bullish scenario, where if bulls can reclaim the powerful support turned resistance level between $9,000 and $9,600, a return to the bull run before the end of the year is possible. Any upward movement would be the result of one of two remaining diagonal trendlines drawn from Bitcoin’s bear market bottom holding as support.

The bearish scenario has Bitcoin breaking below the higher of the two trendlines, and if that occurs, bulls will need to hope that the final diagonal support remains unbroken or the crypto asset could return to its bear market bottom, or potentially even set a new, lower low.

For now, Bitcoin price continues to trade at roughly $8,000, and how it reacts to either $7,000 below or $9,000 above will hold the key to the future of the cryptocurrency.
