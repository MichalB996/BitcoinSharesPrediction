It’s time for the last forecast of this year, so continue reading to find out our Bitcoin price prediction for December 2019.

Bitcoin Overview

Bitcoin is the number one cryptocurrency in the world, both in terms of market capitalization and price.

It was the first cryptocurrency ever to be created, being launched in 2009 by its anonymous creator or creators that go under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto.

Bitcoin is the most widely used crypto, having been accepted as a payment method by many merchants, with many starting to use BTCs in real-time.

Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analysis

While towards the end of October, BTC/USD surprisingly rebounded to $10,000, Bitcoin started going back to $9,000 levels in November. Bearish sentiments continued to rise as midway through the month of November; it started plummeting from the $9,000 mark.

Even if in the past two years, Bitcoin has seen positive movements in November, it appears that this year, Bitcoin seems likely to break the historical pattern.

The bear trend moved Bitcoin from the $10,000-$9,000 support levels to $8,000-$7,000 values. Currently, Bitcoin is struggling to maintain itself above the $7,200 mark.

On November 25th, Bitcoin plummeted to $6,628, which represents a 40% loss against the US dollar from its value of $10,600 on October 26. The price recovered back to $7,146 levels by the end of the day.

November 26th continued trading at over $7,000 levels. Only on November 27th, BTC slip below $7,000, with the rest of November trading only between $7,400 and $7,800 values.

As in November, it seemed that Bitcoin’s price stabilized above $6,000, there was the hope of a gradual recovery, and an eventual comeback to $20,000 in 2019.

If prices are to go back to previous historical highs, then Bitcoin should skyrocket from current price levels at a faster pace. This would mean that Bitcoin should have to trade above $9,000 by the week of December 23rd, 2019.

Although Bitcoin has recovered from $6,600 substantially, it will most likely increase a bit in the short term due to oversold conditions according to technical indicators, and low volumes indicate that there is a lack of buying demand for Bitcoin at the current price. A hopeful Bitcoin price prediction would place BTC back to $10,000 levels, but conservative analysts think this is highly improbable.

Today, December 9th, Bitcoin is trading at $7,495.58, with a decrease of 0.25% in the last 24-hours. The current 24-hour trading volume is $15,580,409,200, which is among the lowest values of the coin for the past month.

The current pivot, resistance, and support levels calculated by WalletInvestor are:

Resistance Level (R3): 7922.267

Resistance Level (R2): 7740.773

Resistance Level (R1): 7595.667

Pivot Point: 7414.173

Support Level (S1): 7269.067

Support Level (S2): 7087.573

Support Level (S3): 6942.467

Developments

In 2020, the reward block for Bitcoin will halve from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 Bitcoins. Halving affects miners and their ability to make a profit, as the cost of the investment is the same while the reward is reduced.

The costs of mining, namely electricity and computing power, might cost more than the reward in most cases. However, some will take into account that the supply is nearing its end.

With most coins, before a halving, there is usually a surge in demand, as traders are readying themselves for a scarcer supply.

Bitcoin is supported on all exchanges, not to mention a wide number of online shops, casinos, and other services. In terms of adoption, Bitcoin has nothing to worry about.
