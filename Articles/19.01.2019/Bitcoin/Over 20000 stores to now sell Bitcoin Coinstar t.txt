Coin cashing giant, Coinstar, has announced that they will now be offering its users an option to buy Bitcoins from loose change instead of converting them to cash. The company has partnered with cryptocurrency startup Coinme, to make this possible.

Coinme is the largest Bitcoin ATM operator in the United States. It was founded in 2014, and currently handles millions worth of transactions every month.

Coinstar operates more than 20,000 Kiosks in the convenience store across North America and Europe. The Kiosks allow for the changing of coins to paper cash. Their service is popular across all USA, where more than 50,000 people exchange their coins through Coinstar daily.

“Coinstar is always looking for new ways to offer value to our consumers when they visit our kiosks, and Coinme’s innovative delivery mechanism along with Coinstar’s flexible platform makes it possible for consumers to easily purchase Bitcoin with cash,” commented Jim Gaherity, Coinstar CEO.

Instead of sending Bitcoin to your address, Coinstar Kiosks would print a voucher and point to the nearest Coinme ATM, where it can be redeemed for cryptocurrencies. The current max limit is $2,500.
