We can now retrace the stolen Bitcoins, according to researchers

Digibank by DBS placed a credit freeze in some accounts due to fiat-to-crypto transactions

The SupremeCourt will now hear the cryptocurrency case on February 26

In critically acclaimed, Golden Globe winner for best drama series, Mr Robot, Season 3, protagonist Elliot Alderson once said:

Encrypting Evil Corp‚Äôs data was meant to empower us. Instead, it left us powerless, scaring us into even more submission.

With Bitcoin dipped below its threshold where it is no longer efficient to mine in most countries of the world, and millions of Bitcoin getting lost or stolen, Alderson‚Äôs statement reflects the real scenario of the real virtual currency too.

Despite presenting itself as the most secure and safest alternate form of currency, time and again Bitcoin has failed to deliver the same. In 2018 alone, according to Credit Karma, Americans alone lost $1.7 Bn worth of Bitcoins.

According to reports, while $1.1 Bn worth of cryptocurrency was stolen in the first half of 2018, out of 17,489,338 Bitcoins mined so far, almost 6 Mn Bitcoin is either lost or stolen.

Can we retrace the stolen Bitcoin?

Researchers Mansoor Ahmed, Ilia Shumailov and Ross Anderson in their research paper ‚ÄúTendrils of Crime: Visualizing the Diffusion of Stolen Bitcoins‚Äù recently published at Cornell University, have described ways to visualise relevant data on a blockchain. Based on the visualisation, they have come up with a graphical model to retrace the stolen coins and then implement this using a variety of visualization techniques.

After Kotak, ICICI, Digibank Freezes Accounts Due To Crypto Transactions

While Kotak Mahindra and ICICI banks have already frozen some accounts due to the account holders‚Äô engagement in crypto transactions, it‚Äôs now digibank by DBS which in a notification informed some of its users that it was constrained to place a credit freeze in their account as the fiat-to-crypto transactions are not allowed in India.
