Bitcoin has jumped above $7,000, continuing a stunning comeback for the cryptocurrency in 2019.

The virtual currency climbed close to $7,600 on Sunday, according to industry website CoinDesk. It's since pared gains, but is still holding above that $7,000 level.

It marks yet another move higher for the world's most-valuable cryptocurrency, which is now up nearly 90% since the start of the year.

That's despite negative headlines surrounding bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, whose parent company has been hit with a probe in New York, and Binance, which was hacked in a heist that lost more than $40 million in bitcoin.

"Bitcoin has been building up momentum," Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at social trading firm eToro, told CNBC via telephone. "Ever since the mid-December lows, we've actually doubled in price."

According to Greenspan, the digital currency could soar because bitcoin is still only "in the early part of its cycle." Bitcoin was once worth nearly $20,000 in late December 2017, before a massive slump last year.

"It has this way of jumping 100s of percentage points and retreating," he said. "Right now we're coming off that huge retracement and are only seeing a small rise."
