A polish cryptocurrency exchanged called Coinroom shut down on April 2, 2019, taking multiple customer accounts worth up to $15,000. The site is currently down and there is no way to contact the founders.

“We don’t know how much they took,” said one user named Maciej. “But it is definitely a lot of cash.”

Polish news site Money.pl first discovered the exit scam on May 31.

“Coinroom registered as a business in 2016 and a year later opened its website. Clients could deposit, buy, and sell cryptocurrencies. They could also exchange cryptocurrency for fiat,” wrote Marcin Łukasik on Money.pl. “In April users received an email that told them that their accounts would be closed. They had one day to get their cash out. In order to do this they had to contact the exchange admins directly. Everything was laid out in the terms of service the users signed.”

The exchange closed the next day and users who did not follow the proper procedure – one laid out by the exchange itself – lost their assets.
