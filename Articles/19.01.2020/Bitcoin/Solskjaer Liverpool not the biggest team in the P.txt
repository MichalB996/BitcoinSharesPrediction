Manchester United coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Liverpool are not the biggest team in the Premier League history. He compared it to Alex Ferguson’s notes with the Red Devils.

Liverpool is on the right track to lift the first league title since 1990. The reason, Juergen Klopp’s troops are still untouched or unbeaten in 21 matches in the domestic competition (20 wins and one draw).

The impressive record makes Liverpool 13 points ahead of its closest competitor Manchester City. The club nicknamed the Reds seems to want to sharpen its good report card when they welcome eternal rival United at Anfield Stadium on Sunday (1/19/2020) night hrs.

Solskjaer’s record is not shaken by Liverpool’s dazzling statistics. He said a long life is a key to greatness. Because he never felt that sensational record while under the care of legendary coach Ferguson. And, the 46-year-old coach stressed that longevity is the key to success.

‘If you take a long look, the best team is one who can do it over and over again. Nothing really matches Sir Alex in that, but I will be the first to admit Juergen Klopp has done a good job at Liverpool,’ said Solskjaer quoted from LiveScore.

At the moment Klopp seems to know what he will get every time he takes the team out, even though we have only been through half the season and there are still many matches to go.

‘If you look at Liverpool now, they have 33 wins and five draws from their last 38 league matches. That’s 104 points, so it will be a good season. They can certainly win the treble winners this season, but let’s see where they are at. in May. They have some difficult matches to come,’ concluded Solskjaer.
