Both the bears’ pressure and the bulls’ pressure were still at equilibrium; the BTC is still range-bound between the resistance level of $4,249 and the support level of $3,677. The Bulls made an attempt to penetrate the resistance level of $4,249 on January 6 with the formation of a strong daily bullish candle but resisted by the confluence at the mark.

BTC/USD Medium-term Trend: Bullish

BTC/USD is bullish on the medium-term outlook. BTC price has been on sideways movement for more than a week hovering over and on the two EMAs within the range of $4,249 resistance level and $3,679 support level. There was a strong bullish push towards the $4,249 price level with the formation of a strong massive bullish candle but unable to break through the resistance level.
