In light of the recent surge in the spread of Covid-19, the Federal Government has expanded its measures of curbing the virus by ordering a school shut down across the country.

This decision came after 9 new cases of infection were confirmed in the last 48 hours. The Lagos and Kwara state governments had earlier ordered the shutdown of schools in their states. However, with the presidential directive, all schools in all the states of the federation will have to join the school shut down.

Today, 4 new cases of #COVID19 were confirmed in Nigeria; a total of 12 confirmed cases in Nigeria
