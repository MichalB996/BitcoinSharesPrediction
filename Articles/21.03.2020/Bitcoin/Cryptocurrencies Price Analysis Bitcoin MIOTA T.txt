The crypto market has taken a completely opposite turn in today’s financial trading trade. Bitcoin is again on the critical price of $6k and looking to break below it. ETH is also suffering heavy price corrections again with the levels dipping to $130.

It looks like the monetary support provided by the Trump Administration wasn’t enough to control the effect of COVID-19 in the crypto market.

The overall market capitalization is $172,269,841,028 and volume traded is $177,007,604,985. The overall dominance of BTC remains at 65%.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis

BTC is having a roller-coaster price movement since yesterday. The world’s largest crypto asset provided some relief to the crypto investors by crossing the crucial price level of $6k. It also looked strong to break another crucial level of $7k. However, the resistance of $6800 came in between and put a halt on the bullish move. Since then, BTC has been a victim of bearish move again in the market. It has now again broken below $6k which is certainly not a good sign. The current price is $5971.23 with the market cap of $109,153,781,035,150 and volume traded of $21,510,350,985. The crypto asset may find the support level of $5800 if the bears are not that impactful.
