Dash, Digibyte and Bitcoin’s price in the last 90 days is a clear indication of how altcoins are vehicles of profiting if used correctly. Relatively, Dash has seen a 55.23% surge in the last 90 days, while BTC and Digibyte have seen -13.51% and -18.23% respectively.

Dash

Dash is currently, the 20th largest cryptocurrency with $590 million in market cap. The 24-hour time frame saw a dip in its price by 2%. However, at press time, more surge seems to be on its way with the formation of a descending triangle and increasing green histograms in the Awesome Oscillator.

Digibyte

Digibyte’s price has formed a pennant, which is sloping upwards and its MACD indicator is showing a quick bullish cross soon. Even for Digitbyte, which is the 67th largest cryptocurrency with only $56 million in market cap, there is a chance for its price to surge higher. The price could move from $0.00435 to $0.005 soon, as it breaks out of the symmetrical triangle.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin’s price saw a dip to $6,040 but surged higher as it found support at $5,900. At press time, the total market cap of bitcoin comes up to $112 million and has a 24-hour trading volume of $30 billion. The price could see a strong surge up to $6,400 since the RSI shows a bounce from the oversold zone.

Due to Bitcoin’s surge and its dominance, it could push the price of altcoins higher as well.
