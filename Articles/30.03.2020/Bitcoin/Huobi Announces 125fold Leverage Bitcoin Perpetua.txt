Huobi Announces Perpetual Swap Transactions

The purchase and sale of the product in question can be made through Huobi DM, Huobi’s derivative trading platform. After BitMEX, Binance and finally OKEx cryptocurrency exchange, Huobi was also expected to take this step.

Although Huobi DM offers many cryptocurrency-based derivative services to users, perpetual swap operations are known to be one of the most popular products of recent months. Investors will be able to take advantage of Bitcoin’s price movements without having real BTC thanks to this product.

The 125-fold leverage offered presents a great opportunity and risk. Especially users who are foreign to leveraged transactions are also recommended to trade with a minimum amount of leverage.
