Bitcoin price dropped below $ 6 thousand last night and for a while it hovered between $ 5,800-6 thousand. Bitcoin rose over $ 6,000 again in the morning, but the danger remains.

Critical Level

Bitcoin price has increased up to $ 6 thousand 300 according to current data. However, according to some cryptocurrency commentators, Bitcoin is currently going through a very critical process.

Although BTC dropped below $ 6,000 last night, it managed to survive thanks to support at $ 5,800. However, it seems that BTC is not even firing this test again.

According to Josh Rager, investors need to pay particular attention to the $ 5,300 level at this time. Rager thinks that if BTC falls below this level, a sharp drop may be seen.

Rookie, one of the domestic crypto commentators, draws attention to a similar level, 5,200 dollars.

Ascension May Come

We can see that the price of Bitcoin is on the rise rapidly if sufficient volume is formed. Reviewers like Deep Blue think that BTC might push the $ 6,400 level first.

However, if sufficient volume cannot be formed and BTC drops, it seems that the first level to be considered will be 5,800 dollars.
