Perhaps it’s a world first. The team at TravelbyBit, an online travel booking platform for people who want to use cryptocurrencies to pay for flights, accommodations, meals and retail items while traveling around the world, is showing off an instant meal purchase using Bitcoin.

Zipping through the Origin Kebab Eagleby Drive-Thru in Queensland, Australia, the TravelbyBit team member orders a six-nugget meal. To pay for his nuggets in Bitcoin, he scans the barcode on the merchant’s tablet using his Lightning Network-enabled wallet.

“It makes transactions cheap and fast.”

After a few seconds, the transaction is confirmed. In addition to Bitcoin, the eatery accepts Litecoin and Binance Coin.

World's first Bitcoin drive-thru? 🚗🌯 While we're enjoying some Bitcoin Lightning nuggets paid using @walletofsatoshi, we thank the developers who are working on #LightningNetwork! ⚡️ Hope all of you enjoy @LNconf in Berlin this weekend! 😊 pic.twitter.com/n5VMLI5fbx — TravelbyBit (@TravelbyBit) October 18, 2019

The TravelbyBit team also reports that yet another supermarket in Australia has started accepting cryptocurrency: Josh’s IGA Murray Bridge West.

Earlier this year, cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which is pushing real-world adoption of cryptocurrencies, launched a cash-to-Bitcoin brokerage service that operates through a network of 1,300+ newsstands across Australia.

Binance’s Italy community manager Lucia Quaglia chronicled her six-day journey across crypto-friendly Brisbane, Townsville and Sydney, spending Bitcoin, Binance Coin and other cryptocurrencies.
