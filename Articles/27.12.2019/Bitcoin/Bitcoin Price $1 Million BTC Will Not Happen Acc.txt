Bitcoin Price Bitcoin Price: $1 Million BTC Will Not Happen, According to CSW

Craig Wright is back with his â€˜pricelessâ€™ bitcoin comments. This time he chose Christmas to share his opinion on BTCâ€™s future price action. Mr. Faketoshi thinks that bitcoin â€˜is not gonna keep going up in valueâ€™.

Since bitcoin started trading on various crypto exchanges and noticeably reached its all-time high in December, scores of analysts and industry influencers have predicted astronomical valuations for BTC. The most discussed of all predictions being John McAfeeâ€™s johnson detaching $1 million price call.

Thereâ€™s no â€˜Million Dollar Bitcoinâ€™

Although Wright didnâ€™t directly point fingers, he definitely didnâ€™t stop short at decrying a $1 million price prediction for bitcoin. According to him:

There is not enough money globally to have million dollar bitcoin.

Faketoshi: "Bitcoin is never going to 1 million dollars, there is not enough money in the world for that & it will never go even to 20k again, unless some Tether type scam launders money & people will go to Jail cause thats law" Me: "Honey Badger don't care ðŸ–• Number Go Up" ðŸš€ðŸŒ• pic.twitter.com/WAb3axm2bs â€” Crypto Meme Central ðŸ”žJan 3ðŸ”‘ (@CryptoScamHub) December 26, 2019

Speaking in his usual pause-filled manner, CSW mentioned that â€˜Tether isnâ€™t going to pump anymoreâ€™ followed by â€˜this is deadâ€™.

Actually his â€˜thoughtfulâ€™ remarks linking bitcoinâ€™ price rise to USDT pump are nothing but a reiteration of the FUD-filled Bloomberg article, which called out the 2017 price rally as a giant market manipulation scheme involving Tether.

BTC.. isnâ€™tâ€¦ Going.. to.. 20, to 40, to 50, to a 100â€¦

It is pretty clear from Craigâ€™s perception of Tether that he clearly doesnâ€™t understand that stablecoins have a broader use-case rather than just pumping bitcoinâ€™s price and the aggregated crypto markets.

This is why he thinks that if bitcoin is going to appreciate in value, it will involve â€˜people pumping something with some Tether type thingâ€™ for which they will end up in prison.

As mentioned earlier, this doesnâ€™t remotely feel like him providing some genuine explanation, as most of it is a borrowed theory from a mainstream media outlet article. From what we know, this isnâ€™t Wrightâ€™s first attempt at establishing his credibility as a â€˜Bitcoin thought leaderâ€™ (read Bitcoinâ€™ creator).

John McAfee Thinks Otherwise

Considered as a vocal proponent of bitcoin and digital assets, John McAfee has unapologetically maintained his stance on bitcoinâ€™s price. Craig Wright has not shied away from asserting his famous claim either but we all know, who holds more weight.

In October, Mr. McAfee went as far as to say that mathematics as a science will have failed if bitcoin price doesnâ€™t hit $2 million by 2020. Not to say the least, the claim akin to his BTC price call is equally bold.

But then, coming from one of the most prolific computing minds of our generation, we can at least expect John to have a rational explanation to back his comments.
