PR: Bitcoin.com Partners with Resistance - the Next Gen DEX

August 29th, 2019 – Last week, the Resistance team met with Bitcoin.com CEO Stefan Rust, and other members of the Bitcoin.com organization, to discuss the terms of a partnership. The meeting was a great success and a strategic partnership agreement was drawn up and signed the same day.

The exact details of the agreement are yet to be announced, but this important development will help to make the Resistance decentralized exchange and privacy coin accessible to the masses through Bitcoin.com’s significant presence in the blockchain space.

“Joining forces with a company that has such incredible strengths in the blockchain industry, together with our team of technology and cryptographic geniuses, it’s possible for us to change the world.” says Resistance CEO, Anthony Khamsei.

The Resistance platform, accessed through the Resistance Desktop Application includes a decentralized exchange, ResDEX, privacy coin (RES), and CPU-optimized miner that allows users to mine on the Resistance blockchain with a regular computer. The platform also gives users the option to receive block rewards through Proof of Research by committing processing power to real scientific research projects.

The Resistance IEO is complete and the platform’s Mainnet has been live for over a month with over 3,000 CPUs mining on the blockchain. Their masternode network was released on 25th August, and ResDEX will launch in less than a week from now.
