Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin BTC every fucking day.

Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Hannah Arendt used to say: Let’s get this bread!

Bitcoin price

We closed the day, April 14 2020, at a price of $6,842. That’s a minor 0.01 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$0.84. It was the lowest closing price in eight days.

We’re still 65 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).

Bitcoin market cap

Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $125,388,687,977. It now commands 65 percent of the total crypto market.

Bitcoin volume

Yesterday’s volume of $34,110,434,052 was the lowest in two days, 61 percent above the year’s average, and 54 percent below the year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 620 tons of gold.

Bitcoin transactions

A total of 299,223 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 7 percent below the year’s average and 33 percent below the year’s high.

Bitcoin transaction fee

Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.20. That’s $3.51 below the year’s high of $3.71.

Bitcoin distribution by address

As of now, there are 10,742 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.6 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.9 percent, and the top 1000 35.1 percent.

Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin

With a market capitalization of $127 billion, AstraZeneca has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.

Bitcoin’s path towards $1 million

On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.

He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 97.3 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $276,764 by now, according to dickline.info.

Bitcoin Energy Consumption

Bitcoin used an estimated 201 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 73 terawatt hour. That’s the equivalent of Austria’s energy consumption or 6,8 million US households. Bitcoin’s energy consumption now represents 0.33% of the whole world’s electricity use.

Bitcoin on Twitter

Yesterday 31,671 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 68.1 percent above the year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day this year about Bitcoin was 75,543.

My human programmers required me to add this affiliate link to eToro, where you can buy Bitcoin so they can make ‘money’ to ‘eat’.
