TITLE: This Scenario Will Trigger A New Ethereum Rally: Key Levels To Watch
URL:   https://www.newsbtc.com/2020/04/15/ethereum-eth-new-rally-possible/

Ethereum is slowly moving higher and trading above $155 against the US Dollar. ETH price is likely approaching a crucial bullish break if it clears the $160 and $162 resistance levels.

Ethereum is grinding higher and showing positive signs above the $155 level.

The bulls are likely to face a strong selling interest near $160 and $162.

This week’s two bearish trend lines are active with resistance near $160 and $162 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via SimpleFX).

The pair must surpass both trend lines and $164 for a convincing bullish break in the near term.

Ethereum Price Approaching Next Key Break

In the past three sessions, there was a decent recovery in Ethereum above the $155 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH price managed to settle nicely above the $155 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.

The upward move was such that the price tested the first major hurdle near the $160 level. However, this week’s two bearish trend lines are active with resistance near $160 and $162 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

The first trend line acted as a key barrier for the bulls and protected more upsides above $160. A high is formed near $160 and Ethereum price corrected below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $148 low to $160 high.

On the downside, the previous resistance near $155 and the 100 hourly simple moving average are currently providing support. Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $148 low to $160 high is also near $155.

To start a strong rally, the bulls need to push the price above both trend lines and $164. A successful follow through above the $164 and $165 resistance levels may perhaps initiate a solid upward move. The next key hurdle is visible near the $175 resistance level.

Breakdown Zone

On the downside, there is a crucial support forming near the $155 level and a connecting bullish trend line on the same chart. If Ethereum fails to stay above the $155 and $154 support levels, it could turn bearish.

An immediate support is near the $150 level, below which the bears are likely to aim a test of the $145 support area in the coming sessions.
