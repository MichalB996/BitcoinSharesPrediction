There are different causes to be optimistic about Bitcoin

No matter your stance is on the mannequin, Nguyen made is for certain that he’s removed from bearish on Bitcoin. The truth is, he’s extraordinarily bullish.

As a substitute of citing the stock-to-flow mannequin, the previous Chaincode Labs resident defined that he’s optimistic in regards to the prospects of Bitcoin for the next 4 causes:

Bitcoin’s sound properties as a type of cash

Its “unforgettable costliness,” referencing miners

And the potential of the Schnorr Signature and Taproot applied sciences, slated to extend the usability of Bitcoin in some ways, doubtlessly appearing as a boon for adoption.

To not point out, there are macro traits that would favor the cryptocurrency transferring ahead.

Per earlier stories from CryptoSlate, one such development is the idea of Ray Dalio, CIO of Bridgewater Capital, one of many world’s largest hedge funds, that he expects a “new world order” to be established.

As put greatest by Chris Burniske of Placeholder Capital:

“New applied sciences rise as previous programs break, and infrequently it takes a disaster to disclose the failings of the previous system in full.”
