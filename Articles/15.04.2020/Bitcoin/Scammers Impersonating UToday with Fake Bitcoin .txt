A fraudulent Facebook account is impersonating U.Today to promote its fake Bitcoin (BTC) giveaway during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The scammers behind the sham encourage victims to send from 0.05 BTC to 5 BTC to their wallet address to instantly increase the deposited sum by a multiple of five.

Back in January, we also published a warning about a bogus Ethereum giveaway that bad actors launched on behalf of U.Today to celebrate an Apple partnership that never happened.

U.Today never asks its readers to send money for investment purposes and never organizes any giveaways or airdrops. Everyone who posts such messages is a scammer.
