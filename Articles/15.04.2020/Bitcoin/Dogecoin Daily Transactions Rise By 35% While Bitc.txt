As seen in February, the daily transaction of DOGE was around 24,000. While the number increased to 32,000 daily transactions as of April 12. This is a clear cut increase of 35%.

Dogecoin is an approachable alternative to Bitcoin

Dogecoin is a unique, open-source peer-to-peer digital currency and till now it does not take part in halving events. Originally the DOGE was introduced as a joke but eventually, it was found an approachable alternative to Bitcoin.

In February 2015, DOGE has experienced a decrease, and now, it continues to attract miners which can be evidenced by its active network.

However, due to the fluctuating market and the pandemic attack globally, the Bitcoin market almost depleted in its daily transactions from 316,000 on Feb. 20 to 228,000 on April 12.

Dogecoin is a secured platform

Some speculators often associate the increase in DOGE prices with unconventional periods. Apart from the origin as a joke coin, it is also a secure platform. Last year it was noticed that DOGE is ranked as the third most resilient cryptocurrency in a possible 51% attack after Bitcoin and Ethereum.

At the time of writing, the coin has a relative increase of 0.52% with a market capitalization of $242,892,127 USD and a circulating supply of 124,150,800,692 DOGE. It has improved its trading volume as compared to last year.
