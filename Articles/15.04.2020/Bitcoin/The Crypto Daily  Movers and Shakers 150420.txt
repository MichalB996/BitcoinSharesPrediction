It was a bullish start to the day for the rest of the majors.

For the Bitcoin Day Ahead

Bitcoin would need to avoid sub-$6,870 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $6,985.13 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from the morning high $6,940.6.

Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Tuesday’s high $6,985 will likely limit any upside.

In the event of an extended rally, the second major resistance level at $7,096.27 could come into play.

Failure to avoid sub-$6,870 levels could see Bitcoin spend the day in the red.

A fall back through the morning low $6,808.0 would bring the first major support level at $6,762.73 into play.

Barring an extended crypto sell-off, however, Bitcoin should continue to steer of sub-$6,500 support levels.

In the event of a sell-off, the second major support level at $6,651.47 would come into play.
