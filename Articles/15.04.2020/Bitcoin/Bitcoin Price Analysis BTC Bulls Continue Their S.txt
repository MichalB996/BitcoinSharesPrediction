Bitcoin saw a small 1.18% price rise today as the cryptocurrency continues to battle to remain above the $6,800 support level. $6,800 had provided significant resistance in March and early April and therefore is expected to provide an equal amount of support moving forward.

However, if the tide turns, and Bitcoin falls beneath $6,800, it could result in the cryptocurrency unwinding back beneath $6,000. Luckily, the bulls have battled to remain above this level over the past 5-days of trading and have been successful thus far.
