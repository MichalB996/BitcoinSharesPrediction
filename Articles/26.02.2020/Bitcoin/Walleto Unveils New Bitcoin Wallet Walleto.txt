Walleto has unveiled its new Bitcoin Wallet, an enabled entity with custodial lightning network designed to make Bitcoin more easily accessible and mobile.

Unlike existing Bitcoin bureaucratic payment systems, transacting from anywhere in the world are possible at any given time. The associated costs and transaction times are often unpredictable with users being offset by having to remember private keys,but Walleto says it has solved these problems thanks to its easy-to-use interface, low fees and custodial design.

Commenting on the partnership, Sulim Malook, chief executive of Walleto Limited said: “We continuously monitor developments in bitcoin and the lightning network because the thinking behind it is ideal for the micro payments associated with lottery.

“Making deposits and withdrawals with fiat currency is time-consuming and costly. Walleto will provide the quickest transactions in crypto with costs lower than any other lottery operator worldwide, helping our players play and collect their winnings without delay.”

Built by Peach, the Bitfury Group’s bitcoin payments engineering division, Chris Dickson, head of blockchain solutions, added: “Walleto is a user-friendly and fully customisable wallet for businesses who want to offer custodial bitcoin wallets as part of their services.

“We look forward to seeing the advancement of bitcoin payments through the efforts of Walleto, Earn Bitcoin and Crypto Millions Lotto.”

Malook added: “We could not be more pleased with the Peach wallet that has been customized for us by the Bitfury team. Their experience in software development and reputation in cryptocurrency precedes them.”
