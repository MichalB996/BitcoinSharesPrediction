Another stale block has been recorded on Bitcoin BUY NOW’s blockchain, the second one in under a week.

Stale blocks are not rare on Bitcoin’s blockchain, but they usually tend to happen months apart. However, BitMEX Research is reporting that Bitcoin had another stale block today after also having one on Feb 22.

Another Stale Bitcoin Block

BitMEX Research is reporting of a three-second time gap on Bitcoin’s blockchain due to a stale block. The stale block contained 625 transactions which all were included in the next few blocks, so nothing of value was lost.

Bitcoin had a stale block this morning at height 619,141: * 3 second time gap

* First stale block since 2020-02-22

* No double spends – The stale block contained 625 txns excluded from the competing block, which all made it into the next few blockshttps://t.co/uzJXPLZduO pic.twitter.com/lTn0C6by9S — BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) February 27, 2020

Stale blocks occur when miners solve the same block at the same time. However, they seem to be happening more frequently. Bitcoin recorded its first stale block since October 2019 on Jan 27 of this year, as BeInCrypto reported. It resulted in a double-spend of $3.

However, since then Bitcoin has recorded two more stale blocks — one on Feb 22 and another yesterday. That means that we’ve had three stale blocks on Bitcoin’s network in under a month, which is surprising. Generally, stale blocks are far rarer.

No Reason to Worry (Hopefully)
