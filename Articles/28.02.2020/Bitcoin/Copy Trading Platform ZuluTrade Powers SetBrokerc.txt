Copy Trading Platform ZuluTrade Powers SetBroker.com

SetBroker, an innovative Bitcoin-based copy-trading platform, announced today their successful launch. Their platform is powered by ZuluTrade’s technology and Traders ecosystem.

Setbroker.com’s unique sales incentive is that it will exclusively use Bitcoin for funding Investors’ trading accounts. The project is expected to transform the cryptocurrency trading market using blockchain and Bitcoin technology combined with a solid system of trading strategies.

ZuluTrade, founded in 2007, bridged the trading gap by building an online and mobile Platform that connects Traders who have built good strategies with investors (followers) who can copy those trades in real-time, into their own investment accounts. ZuluTrade provides the largest, truly open-trading ecosystem, operating globally and regulated in the EU, Japan and now in the USA. The innovative Platform offers ZuluTrade’s proprietary technology via B2B collaborations with entrepreneurs who want to become involved with the industry. SetBroker.com is the latest outcome of such an alliance.

Roula Pelehrinis, ZuluTrade’s Head of Institutional Sales, commented: “We have always been interested in B2B partnerships and when SetBroker approached us with this savvy idea, we took the opportunity to welcomed it into our ever-expanding Partnership Groups and to strategically expand our broker-scope into the Cryptocurrencies sector for our Investors.”

James Townsend, SetBroker Managing Director commented: “Today’s investors are savvy. They are looking for new ways to build upon their investment strategies. At the end of the day, they want the best performance for the funds that they are spending their hard earned dollars on. SetBroker, powered by ZuluTrade will allow first time traders to familiarize themselves with the financial markets and gain confidence to trade.”

Setbroker.com is now available under the brand “Setbroker”. As in all leveraged financial products, No “safe” trading system has ever been devised, and no one can guarantee profits or freedom from loss. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
