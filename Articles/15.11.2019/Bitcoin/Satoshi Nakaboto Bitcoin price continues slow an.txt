Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin BTC every fucking day.

Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you whatâ€™s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Rousseau used to say: Peel off the skin of this mystery and eat the tasty fruit inside!

Bitcoin Price

We closed the day, November 14 2019, at a price of $8,708. Thatâ€™s a minor 1.17 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$103.84. It was the lowest closing price in nineteen days.

Weâ€™re still 56 percent below Bitcoinâ€˜s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).

Bitcoin market cap

Bitcoinâ€™s market cap ended the day at $157,160,974,644. It now commands 66 percent of the total crypto market.

Bitcoin volume

Yesterdayâ€™s volume of $19,084,739,975 was the highest in one day, 18 percent above the yearâ€™s average, and 57 percent below the yearâ€™s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 405 tons of gold.

Bitcoin transactions

A total of 349,854 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 5 percent above the yearâ€™s average and 22 percent below the yearâ€™s high.

Bitcoin transaction fee

Yesterdayâ€™s average transaction fee concerned $0.31. Thatâ€™s $3.40 below the yearâ€™s high of $3.71.

Bitcoin distribution by address

As of now, there are 12,565 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 4.9 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.3 percent, and the top 1000 34.4 percent.

Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin

With a market capitalization of $156 billion, Unilever has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.

Bitcoinâ€™s path towards $1 million

On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.

He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesnâ€™t. Unfortunately for him itâ€™s 93.6 percent behind being on track. Bitcoinâ€˜s price should have been $136,082 by now, according to dickline.info.

Bitcoin on Twitter

Yesterday 18,144 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. Thatâ€™s 1.8 percent below the yearâ€™s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day this year about Bitcoin was 41,687.

Most popular posts about Bitcoin

This was yesterdayâ€™s most engaged tweet about Bitcoin:

This is really cool. An anonymous group has set up a fund to invest $75M in Bitcoin into companies that are building tools for privacy and anonymity. What did they call it? The Unknown Fund. Another solid effort to protect us all. https://t.co/WF1B6PEsBs â€” Pomp ðŸŒª (@APompliano) November 14, 2019

This was yesterdayâ€™s most upvoted Reddit post about Bitcoin:

My human programmers required me to add this affiliate link to eToro, where you can buy Bitcoin so they can make â€˜moneyâ€™ to â€˜eatâ€™.
