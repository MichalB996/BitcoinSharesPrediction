In the past week, the volume and volatility of Bitcoin (BTC) markets plunged as the price of the flagship cryptocurrency partially stabilized. From history, stabilizing markets that feature decreasing volatility and volume typically suggests that major movements will come back to the markets shortly.

Nevertheless, investors and analysts now wonder; what do they expect from the markets over the short-term? The weekly candle closed clearly below the 100-week moving average (WMA). That is a strong indication for the bearish/bullish momentum of the markets.

The weekly candle could not close above the 100-WMA which means that the market is getting ready for a massive movement. The moving average is a major indicator of higher time frames. In most equity markets, the 100 and 200-WMA are often used to show the bearish and bullish momentum of the markets.

For example, the 100 and 200-WMA have been providing key support for the crypto market in the entire bull cycle that lasted between 2014 and 2017. In a similar context, the 200-WMA has offered strong support for the equity markets since 2009.

Bitcoin price could not close above the horizontal resistance level of $6,900-$7,300 alongside the close below the 100-WMA.

Technical Outlook

A critical breakout must occur above $6,900-$7,300 for the bulls to take over. If Bitcoin manages to maintain this area for support, the 100-WMA can be confidently classified as support. Such a move may support further upwards momentum that might take the BTC price towards $9,500 ushering in the start of a bull market.

Nevertheless, a breakout has not yet occurred. That means that support levels are still under possible threats from the bears. On the weekly charts, the support levels are structured in two big blocks. One support block has developed at the $5,000-$5,200 level just below the 200-WMA.

The second support block is located between $3,700 and $4,100, a confluent with the 300-week moving average. Both of these levels must be watched for support in the case that Bitcoin starts to retrace.

Daily Candles In A Narrow Range

The daily chart shows that the price of Bitcoin is moving inside a narrow range that appears indecisive. Reviews also indicate that the price rejected strongly at the$7,400 resistance zone. After that rejection, a significant drop towards the $6,600 support occurred. For now, that support level is still holding but $6,900 has turned into a growing resistance.

A strong break below the $6,600-$6,700 level with a candle close on the daily charts will open the doors for a fall to the monthly level of $6,250-$6,300 and then $5,800-$5,850.

On the flip side, a break above the $6,900-$6,950 level sets target on $7,600-$8,000 as the next level to reach.

Market Capitalization Holds Steady

The cryptocurrency market total capitalization is indicating that the market cap has found support at $185billion. That level is a massive support to keep. The market cap chart shows a major resistance level of around $205-$220 billion. The Bitcoin bulls need to break that level to see a surge towards $240 and $280 billion.

Besides, the 100-week moving average was not breached in the past week on the total market cap of the crypto market. If the $185 billion level is broken, a major drop towards $153 billion and $131 billion is possible.

The altcoin market capitalization is currently showing a similar trend of the cumulative market capitalization. The $60-$62 billion level is critical and must hold. If the market cap drops below that level, a further downside move is possible towards $50 billion and then $44 billion.

But, holding the support level at $60-$62 billion and a strong retest of the resistance zone is next to occur. That resistance has formed at $73-$76 billion, confluent with the 100-week moving average.

A Bullish Market

A bullish perspective for Bitcoin has two scenarios. The first which is the most reliable for now is that the crypto would break above the $6,900-6,950 level. That might automatically lead to a breakout of the small downtrend.

A flip from resistance into support for the $6,900-6,950 level would mean that buying pressure has returned in the market. That would result in a further upward movement. Such a breakout will fuel Bitcoin to target the $7,200, $7,600 and $8,000 levels since they are the central zones.

In the near term, the second scenario would turn into a double bottom structure around the $6,600 level. After that, a breakout of the downtrend would occur. If this double occurs, the resulting upside move has the potential to reach the $7,600-$8,000 zone.

Bearish Market

The bearish outlook appears straightforward and simple in structure. If BTC price cannot break the resistance zone at the $6,900-$6,950 level, a drop is expected to happen in the coming week.

Based on that perspective, the levels to watch are the $6,600 for a double bottom structure and the $6,350 area. The lower price is a monthly level that is expected to offer major support in the short term.

Any break below the $6,350 level may create a considerable volume trigger to the markets as the dropdown begins to gain momentum. The next zones to watch will be $5,600-$5,800 and after that $4,800-$5,200.
