Reference from the Past

In the past, the increasing demand for USDT has acted as a precursor for a rise in the crypto markets. Last year, during the same time, the increasing supply of USDT was followed by a crypto bull run.

Moreover, notice how increase paused before May as the crypto-bull run began suggesting conversion of USDT to Bitcoin.

In the current macroeconomic environment, the increasing demand for USD is also causing a rise in USDT volume. Light (alias), a crypto trader and analyst tweeted,

Demand for dollars manifesting itself through Tether, with $2.2B issued since mid-March.

Since crypto trading in China faces banking restrictions, traders have used stablecoins to bypass them.

Moreover, even in case of a sell-off from crypto markets, the USDT supply would have eventually converted to non-crypto US Dollar (in banks and cash). However, the fact that traders are choosing a cryptographic version is bullish for the markets.
