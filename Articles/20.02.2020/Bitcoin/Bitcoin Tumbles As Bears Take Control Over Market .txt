On the rebound, Bitcoin then went on to run into resistance at $10,180 and was unable to overcome this resistance – causing it to roll over and fall again.

We can see that Bitcoin dropped as low as $9,280 before bouncing higher again. It found support at a rising trend line which will be a very important level moving forward.

Short term prediction: BULLISH

If the sellers continue to drop BTC back beneath the support at $9,656, the first level of lower support is located at $9,366 (short term .5 Fib Retracement). The support here is further bolstered by the rising trend line.

Beneath this, support lies at $9,200, $9,159, $9,095, and $9,000.

On the other hand, if the bulls bounce higher, resistance lies at $9,637, $9,185, $10,000, and $10,180.

The RSI dipped beneath the 50 level which shows that the sellers are now in charge of the market momentum. For a market recovery, we will need to see the RSI breaking back above the 50 level.

Key Levels

Support: $9,565, $9,366, $9,280, $9,200, $9,159, $9,095, $9,000.
