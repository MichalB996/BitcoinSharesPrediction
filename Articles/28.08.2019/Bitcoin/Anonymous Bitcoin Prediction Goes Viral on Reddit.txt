A series of Bitcoin predictions from an anonymous analyst are catching fire on Reddit.

The forecast was posted on 4chan on January 21st of this year, mapping out BTC’s price movements through November. A screenshot of the original post shot to the top of the Bitcoin subreddit on Tuesday, along with a graph showing the predicted parabolic movement.

On target, the first projection, that Bitcoin would hit at least $5,300 in April, and the second, stating BTC would cross $9,200 by July, were both realized.

But to meet the next target at $16,000 by October of this year, Bitcoin would have to climb 57.64% from today’s current price of about $10,150. The anonymous author also states BTC’s dominance of the overall crypto market will sink to between 40% and 46% – far lower than today’s 68.8%.

The post triggered a lively debate on Bitcoin’s past, present and future price action. Here are some highlights.
