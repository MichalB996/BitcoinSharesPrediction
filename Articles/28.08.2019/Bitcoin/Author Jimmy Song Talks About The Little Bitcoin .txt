In a wide-ranging interview, we speak with author Jimmy Song about his new book, The Little Bitcoin Book: Why Bitcoin Matters for Your Freedom, Finances, and Future.

Written by a collective of crypto thinkers, the book, according to its publisher, “tells the story of what’s wrong with money today, and why Bitcoin was invented to provide an alternative to the current system.”

“It describes in simple terms what Bitcoin is, how it works, why it’s valuable, and how it affects individual freedom and opportunities of people everywhere – from Nigeria to the Philippines to Venezuela to the United States,” wrote Song.

Interestingly, the book took just a few days to write. Song told CoinDesk the origin story, beginning with a meeting in Oslo.

“It really came together at the Oslo Freedom Forum earlier this year when a bunch of us that were in bitcoin got together and we talked about possibly doing something like this,” Song told Dale. “We wrote it in Redwood City, California. We rented a house and we each had our own bedrooms and bathrooms but we pretty much worked in the common areas. It was like four days.”

The book aims to make it easier to understand bitcoin in the context of real usage and real economies and Song hopes it will be an educational and helpful addition to the crypto canon. In fact, Song sees the book as a calling card for crypto.

“The purpose of this book is to give [people] the idea of why [bitcoin] is valuable, why it matters at all,” Song said.
