Fairspin Casino Players Won Over 40,000 ETH

Blockchain casino Fairspin paid out more than 40,000 ETH to players in its first full year of operation.

The casino was founded in late 2018 under the name of Fairplay. A year later, it was rebranded into Fairspin to emphasize the casino’s key distinctive feature – each spin in every game is secured by blockchain. Fairspin’s gaming stats are displayed right on the casino website and everyone can check players’ deposits and payouts on a blockchain explorer.

This blockchain-stored data shows that in 2019 Fairspin paid out more than 40,000 ETH to players. This is close to $6M at the current exchange rate. The actual house edge (the casino advantage) was less than 1% (0,965%, to be exact).

The biggest win from a single bet happened in the Jack and the Beanstalk game – $2,850 at the then exchange rate. The record-high win in a single game session was in the 300 Shields slot – $8,938. The biggest total win in a single day for one player was $14,552.

To make all these figures trackable and proveable, Fairspin utilizes a toolset provided by the TruePlay blockchain platform. It enables Fairspin to record gaming and transaction stats on blockchain while using classic, non-blockchain games from the world’s leading providers.

Last year, the Fairspin team introduced this technology at major iGaming conferences worldwide (iGB London, SiGMA, MAC, and more) in partnership with TruePlay and online gaming regulator Curaçao eGaming.

Fairspin’s innovative approach to blockchain implementation in iGaming was recognized by nominations for several important awards including EGR Operator Awards 2019 and SBC Awards 2019.
