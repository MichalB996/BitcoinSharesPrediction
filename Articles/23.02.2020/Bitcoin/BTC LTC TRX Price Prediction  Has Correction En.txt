BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) didn't follow our recent scenario and bounced off the support at $9,600. Its price has risen by 2.40 percent over the last day.

On the hourly chart, Bitcoin retested the $10,000 mark. However, it could not stay above this level due to a long wick that indicates the weakness of buyers to push the price higher. Even though the long-term forecast remains bullish, there is a high probability of a short sideways trend.

In this case, Bitcoin (BTC) is about to stay in the range between $9,700-$9,800 as it is outlined on the chart.

Bitcoin is trading at $9,910 at press time.

LTC/USD

The 'digital silver' is showing even better price moves than Bitcoin (BTC). The price of Litecoin (LTC) has increased by almost 4 percent over the previous 24 hours.

Litecoin (LTC) is about to finish its long-term run as there are no buyers willing to push the price based on the trading volume. Moreover, the coin's selling trading volume keeps going up, confirming a potential drop. In addition, the coin is located is trapped within a rising wedge pattern. Hence, there is a high chance that the bears might push LTC to $75 shortly.

Litecoin is trading at $79.29 at press time.

TRX/USD

TRX is the main leader on our list. Its price has gone up by more than four percent over the last day. According to the chart below, it is yet to reach its peak.
