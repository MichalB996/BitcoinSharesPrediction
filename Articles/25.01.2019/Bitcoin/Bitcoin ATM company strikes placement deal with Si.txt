Chicago-based Crypto Dispensers has announced that it is placing bitcoin ATMs in shopping malls owned by Simon Property Group and Brookfield Properties, the two largest real estate investment trusts in the U.S.

According to a press release, the company has partnered with Simon to place General Bytes-branded bitcoin ATMs in 30 locations across six states (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin), with more to follow. The cash-in machines allow buyers to exchange fiat currency for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Crypto Dispensers founder and CEO Sabreen Rihan said in the release that the company's vision is "to have our kiosks stationed inside every shopping mall across the U.S."

Chris Juricic, general manager of Lighthouse Place Premium Outlets, one of the earliest Simon properties to install the bitcoin ATMs, said the machine is attracting interest.

"Since stationing the kiosk inside the information center at Lighthouse Place Premium Outlets, we have seen a growing interest in bitcoin from our shoppers," Juricic said. "I have personally observed their customer service to be excellent. I'm excited to see Crypto Dispensers continue to grow."

The partnership with Simon malls is allowing Crypto Dispensers to expand quickly, growing from four locations to 30 in less than one year, the company said.
