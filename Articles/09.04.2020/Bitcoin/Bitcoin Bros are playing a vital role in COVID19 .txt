The COVID-19 pandemic has put a lot of stress on the researchers to put an end to this struggle yet another group of people has promised their support by providing their computational power to finding the cure.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that had its rise to a peak around this time last year, where some people have turned millionaires after investing in. This Bitcoin works on the concept of block-chain where it is interconnected with the former and the later.

This list of this is maintained by something called Ledger, where it has a list of all the public transactions. There is only a limited number of bitcoins in the world, the estimated amount is 21 million which can ever be mined.

If you want to mine the Bitcoin, you should have the tremendous computational power to solve a mathematical equation because as the number of mined coins increases so does the complexity.

The block-chain is cutting edge technology that runs on a decentralized network, in the above case the bank is removed for the equation which is heavily opposed by many governments all across the globe.

The Bitcoin Bros have promised to support the research team who are playing a vital role in the COVID-19 crises. They have promised that they will give their computational power. Besides several other organizations have also stepped up to give the researchers the power they need to solve the crises.

Some of them are the United States Department of Energy research labs, as well as companies like NVIDIA has called out all the gamers all across the world. Companies like IBM, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Google and HPE have also pledged their support.
