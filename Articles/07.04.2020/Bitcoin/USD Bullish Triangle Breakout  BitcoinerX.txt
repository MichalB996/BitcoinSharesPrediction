Bitcoin formed higher lows and found resistance around $6,800, creating an ascending triangle on its 4-hour time frame. Price already broke above the triangle resistance to signal that an uptrend might follow.

To be specific, bitcoin could climb by the same height as the triangle pattern, which spans $5,200 to $6,800 or $1,600. The 100 SMA is below the 200 SMA for now to show that the path of least resistance is to the downtrend or that there’s still a chance that bearish momentum could pick up.

Then again, the gap between the moving averages has narrowed to reflect weakening bearish pressure and a potential bullish crossover. In that case, bitcoin could accelerate its climb as more buyers join in.

Volume appears to be ticking slightly higher to signal that market interest is growing again. ADX is also climbing and above 25 to confirm that trending market conditions could stay in play.

However, stochastic is already indicating overbought conditions or exhaustion among buyers, and turning lower could signal that sellers are taking over. In that case, a pullback to the broken triangle resistance could take place before bitcoin heads any further north.

Bitcoin could be taking advantage of the pickup in risk-taking as the number of cases in certain parts of Europe is ticking lower. Traders are also anticipating more stimulus from governments and central banks, possibly another reason keeping investors a bit more optimistic that markets have turned a corner.

Besides, bitcoin is also looking ahead to the halving of mining rewards next month, which could lead to as much as double the coin’s value in a few months. Keep in mind, however, that the dollar remains strongly bid against its peers, particularly if safe-haven demand kicks into high gear again.
