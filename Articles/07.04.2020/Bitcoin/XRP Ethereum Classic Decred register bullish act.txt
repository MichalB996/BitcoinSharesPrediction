The collective market cap, at press time, rose to $209.7 billion, for the first time since the market’s collapse on 12 March. In fact, at the time of writing, Bitcoin‘s dominance had dropped to 64.4% as well. With the king coin rallying higher and holding its position above the $7,000-mark, altcoins followed suit, breaching their own significant levels.

XRP

Despite being engulfed in controversy about its position, XRP started off on a positive note, rallying close to $0.35. After the subsequent cascading falls over the past month, however, the coin, at the time of writing, appeared to be moving towards a recovery phase.

Ethereum Classic [ETC]
