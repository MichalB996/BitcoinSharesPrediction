Don't be fooled by a stickers that's been put up around Vancouver's West End asking for bitcoin donations

VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) — The Vancouver Pride Society is sounding the alarm over a scam popping up in Vancouver’s West End.

Executive Director Andrea Arnot says a stickers has been put up that bears the Pride Society’s name and encourages people to donate bitcoin by scanning a QR code with their phone.

“I was pretty disappointed in humanity that someone would try and take advantage of the nonprofit organization, and use … our organization to profit, especially during a pandemic,” Arnot says.



Arnot tells NEWS 1130, Pride does not take donations by bitcoin and asks anyone that sees a sign like this to take it down.

“It does look you know legitimate it’s got rainbows as Vancouver pride. And so yeah, I’m hoping that this will stop whoever it is, from keeping on doing it.”
