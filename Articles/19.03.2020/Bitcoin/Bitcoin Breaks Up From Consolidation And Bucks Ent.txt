Bitcoin saw a 6.5% price increase over the past 24 hours of trading as it tries to head back toward $6,000

The cryptocurrency recently broke above a short term consolidation pattern but must break $6,000 before we can become slightly optimistic.



Whilst the wider economy continues to tank Bitcoin is seeing some form of relief as it increases by 6.5% over the past 24 hours of trading. The cryptocurrency broke up above a short term consolidation pattern as it attempts to break above $5,600 and head back toward $6,000.

Meanwhile, major indices such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average continue to see further price declines. Even Gold dropped by a total of over 4% throughout the past 2-days of trading.

Whilst this latest price increase is promising for Bitcoin, it is still too early to become positive as Bitcoin could just be lagging behind the rest of the economy.

Toward the upside, the first level of resistance lies at $5,911 which is provided by a bearish .382 Fib Retracement. Above this, resistance is located at $6,000, $6,174, $6,540 (bearish .5 Fib Retracement), and $6,800.
