The cryptobroker is hiring – just as the rest of the financial services industry is battening down the hatches.

Zug-based Bitcoin Suisse continues to hire despite a dramatic slowdown in the global economy induced by the coronavirus pandemic, finews.com has learned. The cryptocurrency broker expects to clinch a banking license this year, the country's third for a digital asset company.

Since October, when the «crypto valley» heavyweight hit 100 staff, Bitcoin Suisse has expanded to 128 employees, the company confirmed on Thursday. Besides Zug, the company has staff in Liechtenstein and Copenhagen (founder Niklas Nikolajsen is a Danish ex-computer programmer).

Crypto Trading Surge

The expansion of its staff by more than one-quarter comes in a difficult market for crypto assets, which have followed a plummeting in more traditional investments: bitcoin has lost more than 40 percent in value in the past month.

The risk capital that Bitcoin Suisse as well as banks Seba and Sygnum are looking to tap this year is also drying up. Ironically, Bitcoin Suisse is busier than ever: last week it reported a surge in trading volumes, drive by purchase orders, as finews.com reported.
