USDZ Capital Group Launches USDZ Stablecoin

High volatility is one of the major problems of the cryptocurrency, which prevents it from becoming a full-fledged replacement for fiat money at this stage. Cryptocurrency quotes are unstable and can change dramatically in a short period of time. Such price jumps can be observed not only in the first cryptocurrency, but also in all other digital money. This prevents them from being used in everyday life. The creators of cryptocurrencies come up with different ways to solve the problem of volatility. One of them is stablecoins, the main feature of which is exchange rate stability.

Stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to less volatile external assets such as official currencies, precious metals, or oil. The value of a stablecoin can also be pegged to other crypto-assets or fixed by algorithms. Stablecoins retain the same value as the underlying asset and are not subject to sharp price fluctuations. The general idea behind a stablecoin is to maintain a stable value over a long period of time.

Stablecoins play a crucial role in the cryptosystem. They allow more people to access the benefits of blockchain without the risk of sharp price fluctuations. They also provide a solid basis for traders, investors, sellers, and other players who want to keep their profits or assets. Basically, backing a coin with less volatile conventional assets such as the US dollar or gold makes it more stable, thus providing a safer alternative for all players in the crypto community.

Most coins are built on the same principle – a centralized organization keeps assets in the target account and issues the corresponding tokens at the ratio of 1: 1 to the underlying assets. The advantage of USDZ Capital Group is that this company is more transparent in its activities, disclosure of information about its holding companies, reporting, and compliance with regulatory requirements.

USDZ Capital Group consists of professionals with extensive experience in the major companies in the world, such as Lloyds Banking Group, Wincor Nixdorf, Deloitte, Danske Bank. The core of the company consists of five people: CEO Robert Evans, CFO Richard Moore, CCO James Turner, CTO Sebastian Schneider, CMO Kirsten Larsen. USDZ stablecoins are issued on Ethereum blockchain as ERC-20 tokens, which means compatibility with most software, hardware wallets, exchanges, and other projects.

What is USDZ stablecoin?

USDZ was introduced in 2019. It is developed to become a simple, transparent, and reliable stable coin. For this reason, it does not use a hidden bank account or any special algorithm.
