Ripple says a new XRP-based payments app will allow four billion smartphone users to send money anywhere in the world via text.

The app, called Remit, was developed at SLOHacks, a recent hackathon at the California Cybersecurity Institute at California Polytechnic State University. Ripple says the platform leverages the Xpring software development kit (SDK) for XRP and the Twilio application programming interface for text messaging.

“SMS is the most widely used data application on the planet with over 4 billion users worldwide, many of which don’t have access to the internet. Remit now allows these users to send money globally using XRP over SMS and (soon) [Interledger].”

Xpring, Ripple’s development and fundraising arm, sponsored the hackathon where 275 developers gathered to create new and innovative projects in the world of fintech, gaming and cybersecurity.

Remit is the winner of the “Best Use of Xpring” challenge, which focused on creative uses for XRP and the Interledger Protocol (ILP).

Ripple also awarded a runner-up prize to a project called Superconductor, which is a browser extension that allows users to purchase goods and services on eBay and Amazon using XRP and Ethereum (ETH).
