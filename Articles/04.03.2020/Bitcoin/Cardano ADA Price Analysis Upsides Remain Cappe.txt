Cardano Price Analysis

This past week, cardano price extended its decline below the $0.0550 support area against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair even declined below the $0.0500 support and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).

A new monthly low is formed near the $0.0450 and the price is currently correcting higher. It is trading above the $0.0490 and testing the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the downside move from the $0.0620 swing high to $0.0450 low.

On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $0.0515 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Moreover, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.0515 on the 4-hours chart.

If there is an upside break above the $0.0515 and $0.0520 resistance levels, the price could start a decent recovery. An immediate resistance is near the $0.0525 level. It coincides with the 50% downside move from the $0.0620 swing high to $0.0450 low.

Any further gains could lead the price towards the key $0.0550 and $0.0560 resistance levels in the near term. Conversely, the price may perhaps fail to continue higher above the $0.0520 resistance area.

In the mentioned case, there is a risk of a fresh decline below the $0.0480 and $0.0460 levels. The price could even dive below the $0.0450 swing low to continue lower. The next major support below the $0.0450 low is near the $0.0420 area. Any further losses is likely to lead the price towards the $0.0400 area.

The chart indicates that ADA price is clearly facing a lot of hurdles on the upside near the $0.0515 and $0.0520 levels. A successful break above $0.0520 may perhaps start a fresh increase towards the $0.0550 resistance in the coming sessions.
