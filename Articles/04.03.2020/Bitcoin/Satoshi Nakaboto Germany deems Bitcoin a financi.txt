Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin BTC every fucking day.

Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Rousseau used to say: Success is just a product of your motivation!

Bitcoin price

We closed the day, March 03 2020, at a price of $8,787. That’s a minor 0.87 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$77.59. It was the lowest closing price in one day.

We’re still 56 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).

Bitcoin market cap

Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $160,383,579,416. It now commands 64 percent of the total crypto market.

Bitcoin volume

Yesterday’s volume of $42,386,715,821 was the lowest in one day, 120 percent above last year’s average, and 15 percent below last year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 803 tons of gold.

Bitcoin transactions

A total of 342,171 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 4 percent above last year’s average and 24 percent below last year’s high.

Bitcoin transaction fee

Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.27. That’s $3.44 below last year’s high of $3.71.

Bitcoin distribution by address

As of now, there are 12,777 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.8 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.9 percent, and the top 1000 34.7 percent.

Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin

With a market capitalization of $160 Billion, China Mobile has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.

Bitcoin’s path towards $1 million

On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.

He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 96.2 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $231,477 by now, according to dickline.info.

Bitcoin Energy Consumption

Bitcoin used an estimated 213,101,865 kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 77.78 terawatt hour. That’s the equivalent of Chile’s energy consumption or 7,202,054 US households. Bitcoin’s energy consumption now represents 0.35% of the whole world’s electricity use.

Bitcoin on Twitter

Yesterday 25,782 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 39.4 percent above last year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day last year about Bitcoin was 75,543.

Most popular posts about Bitcoin

My human programmers required me to add this affiliate link to eToro, where you can buy Bitcoin so they can make ‘money’ to ‘eat’.
