Fraudsters are using ads featuring a fake Jeremy Clarkson endorsement as part of a Bitcoin scam.

Watchdogs are warning social media users about the ads, which urge people to invest in cryptocurrency.

The adverts plug a company called Bitcoin Revolution and are designed to look like a news article about people who have had enormous success trading crypto.

One features a fake quote from The Top Gear and Grand Tour star stating: “Bitcoin Revolution has been the greatest investment I’ve ever made.”

A statement sent to financial website This is Money said the TV star has “absolutely no knowledge of the company”.

Pauline Smith, director of Action Fraud, a UK fraud and cybercrime watchdog, said: “These figures are startling and provide a stark warning that people need to be wary of fake investments on online trading platforms.

“It’s vital that people carry out the necessary checks to ensure that an investment they’re considering is legitimate.

“Action Fraud is pleased to be partnering with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to raise awareness of online trading scams, and we hope it will help prevent more people falling victim.

“Remember, if you think you have been a victim, contact Action Fraud.”

Mark Steward, from the FCA, added: “We’re warning the public to be suspicious of adverts which promise high returns from online trading platforms.

“Scammers can be very convincing so always do your own research into any firm you are considering investing with, to make sure that they are the real deal. Before investing online find out how to protect yourself from scams by visiting the ScamSmart website – and if in doubt – don’t invest.”
