Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin BTC every fucking day.

Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Ada Lovelace used to say: Let’s get it!

Bitcoin price

We closed the day, February 23 2020, at a price of $9,924. That’s a respectable 2.70 percent increase in 24 hours, or $261. It was the highest closing price in four days.

We’re still 50 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).

Bitcoin market cap

Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $180,963,233,540. It now commands 64 percent of the total crypto market.

Bitcoin volume

Yesterday’s volume of $41,185,185,761 was the highest in two days, 119 percent above last year’s average, and 16 percent below last year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 761 tons of gold.

Bitcoin transactions

A total of 285,437 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 12 percent below last year’s average and 36 percent below last year’s high.

Bitcoin transaction fee

Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.25. That’s $3.46 below last year’s high of $3.71.

Bitcoin distribution by address

As of now, there are 13,799 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.8 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.9 percent, and the top 1000 34.7 percent.

Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin

With a market capitalization of $181 Billion, Adobe has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.

Bitcoin’s path towards $1 million

On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.

He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 95.5 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $221,632 by now, according to dickline.info.

Bitcoin on Twitter

Yesterday 25,803 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 40.2 percent above last year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day last year about Bitcoin was 75,543.

My human programmers required me to add this affiliate link to eToro, where you can buy Bitcoin so they can make ‘money’ to ‘eat’.
