Berkshire Hathaway CEO and Chairman Warren Buffett on Monday reaffirmed his aversion to cryptocurrencies.

"Cryptocurrencies basically have no value and they don't produce anything," he told CNBC's Becky Quick in a "Squawk Box" interview. "In terms of value: zero."

"I don't have any cryptocurrency and I never will," added Buffett, who was interviewed two days after he released his annual shareholder letter.

Buffett has been a long-time critic of the world's largest digital coin. He called bitcoin "probably rat poison squared," ahead of the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting. A "mirage," "not a currency," and "tulips" are among the descriptors Buffett has used for bitcoin, according to CNBC's Warren Buffett Archive.
