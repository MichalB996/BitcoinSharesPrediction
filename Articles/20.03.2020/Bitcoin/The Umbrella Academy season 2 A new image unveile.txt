The Umbrella Academy season 2: A new image unveiled. If many Netflix series are forced to stop filming or editing their next episodes, The Umbrella Academy does not seem to be affected!

This confinement period will benefit streaming platforms. And for good reason, Netflix has an interest in insuring. Soon, the platform should offer season 2 of The Umbrella Academy , a teen show that might appeal to Marvel fans . What worries viewers of the program is that the release is postponed because of the coronavirus.

Faced with the Covid-19 epidemic which affects the whole world, many productions had to pause. This is particularly the case of The Witcher , in the middle of filming its season 2, and also of Lucifer, who was trying to finish his fifth season. If all Netflix productions are on stand-by, this is fortunately not the case for The Umbrella Academy , which had finished shooting its next episodes.

Showrunner Steve Blackman just shared a photo of the editing station with a light message : “Even the corona won’t stop editing The Umbrella Academy. But promised, we wash our hands …”

So this is very good news for fans who wondered where the production was! If Netflix still hasn’t announced a release date for Season 2, it shouldn’t be long . It would be in his interest to broadcast the sequel in a short period of time, because people are thirsty for new programs during this period of confinement!

However, such a series requires a long work on special effects, so it is better not to rush the editing. The plot of this sequel seems really interesting, especially since we know that the apocalypse of season 1 may not have been the real end of the world that the Hargreeves family will face!
