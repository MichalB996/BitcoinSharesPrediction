Bitcoin

Bitcoin saw a small 2.6% price increase from where it was trading seven days ago. However, it had dropped substantially throughout the week. The cryptocurrency fell beneath support at the rising trend line to find additional support at the $6,447 level (short term .618 Fib Retracement).

From here, Bitcoin rebounded yesterday to climb back above the $7,000 level where it currently trades.

Looking ahead, the first level of resistance lies at $7,200 (bearish .5 Fib Retracement). Above this, strong resistance lies at $7,400, which had caused problems during early April 2020. If the bulls can break $7,400, resistance lies at $7,600 (100-days EMA), $7,700, and $8,000 (bearish .618 Fib Retracement & 200-days EMA).
