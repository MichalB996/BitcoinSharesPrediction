Bitcoin resumed its uptrend as it bounced strongly off the bottom of its rising channel on the 4-hour time frame. Price is also breaking past the mid-channel area of interest and could be setting its sights on the channel resistance.

The 100 SMA is above the 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the upside or that the climb is more likely to gain traction than to reverse. Price found support near the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point and has climbed above the 100 SMA, so this could hold as a floor as well.

Volume is slightly elevated, signaling a likely continuation of the climb up to the channel top around $7,700 might be underway. However, stochastic already reached the overbought zone to signal exhaustion among buyers, and turning lower could confirm a return in bearish pressure. ADX has slumped again to suggest potential consolidation.

Bitcoin has drawn support from yet another rebound in risk-taking, likely buoyed by positive coronavirus-related updates, as well as indications that major oil producers are ready to take “further measures” to stabilize the markets.

Recall that much of the selloff earlier on was spurred by a risk aversion stemming from speculations that authorities are not doing enough to limit the impact of the outbreak. However, stocks and commodities recovered in the latest US session as the number of cases and casualties reportedly slowed globally.

Looking ahead, a continuation of this risk-on sentiment could be enough to buoy bitcoin higher and encourage more bulls to establish their long positions ahead of the halving in May. Keep in mind that cutting the mining rewards in half could potentially lead to twice as much value for the coin, at least based on the previous instances.
