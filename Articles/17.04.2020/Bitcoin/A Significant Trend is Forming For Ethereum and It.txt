The bulls pushed the price towards the next key hurdle near $174-$175.

There was a break above a crucial bearish trend line with resistance near $158 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via SimpleFX).

The pair is currently consolidating gains near $170 and it might correct in the short term.

Ethereum Price Rally Looks Real

As discussed on many occasions in the past few days, Ethereum remained well supported above the $145 area against the US Dollar. ETH price traded close to the $145 level and recently started a sharp rise.

There was a break above the $155 resistance level to start a major upward move. More importantly, there was a break above a crucial bearish trend line with resistance near $158 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

It opened the doors for a sharp rally above the $160 barrier and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Ethereum gained bullish momentum and surpassed the $170 resistance. It traded close to the $174-$175 resistance area and it is currently consolidating in a range.

It seems like there is a contracting triangle forming with support near the $168 level. If there is a downside break, the price might correct lower towards $166 or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $146 swing low to $174 high.

Any further losses could lead the price towards the $163 support area (the recent breakout zone). It is also close to the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $146 swing low to $174 high.

More Upsides?

On the upside, there is a major resistance forming near the $174 and $175 levels. If Ethereum price clears the $175 resistance, there are chances of more upsides in the near term.

An immediate hurdle is near the $185 level, above which the bulls are likely to aim a test of the $192 resistance level. Any further gains might lead the price towards the $200 handle.
