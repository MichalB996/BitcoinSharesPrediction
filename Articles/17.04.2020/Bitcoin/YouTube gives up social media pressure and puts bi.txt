Tone Vays is back on YouTube – at least for now. After having its channel deleted by the video company Google, the bitcoin community came together to pressure the social network in favor of the trader who has been in the market since 2013.

The channel was reestablished Thursday (17) a few hours after it was deleted.

“Thank you YouTube for resolving this issue so quickly. I hope it is safe to assume that it was an algorithm that was happy with a ban, ”he said on Twitter.

He tweeted the message above as a complement to the reply he received from the TimeYoutube account also on Twitter, in which he said that he understood the importance of the issue and that he would pass it on so that the company's teams could look more closely.

Vays also thanked the support of the bitcoin community: “It was you who brought my channel back,” he wrote.

More bans on Youtube

On Friday (17), the bitcoin trader again criticized the platform. Although his channel was back on the air, he retweeted a message from the BTC Sessions account, which had his YouTube account deleted on the same charges as Vays.

"Honestly, I think it's a problem with the algorithm and it's not a policy against YouTube's bitcoin," he said.

In Brazil, it is no different. Several channels of youtubers in the cryptocurrency market have been punished in recent months. Even the space of an analyst at the Securities and Exchange Commission was removed from the air without any kind of notice.
