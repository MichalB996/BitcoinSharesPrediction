Coinbase Card owners can now add a virtual version of the card to their Google Pay wallet, making it easier for them to spend their Bitcoin in shops. Support for Google Pay covers more than a dozen European countries.

Coinbase Card is a Visa debit card that was launched by Coinbase back in April 2019. Coinbase debit card users are able to spend 10 different cryptocurrencies directly from their Coinbase balance at any shop that accepts Visa payments.

In additional to the physical card, Coinbase users get a virtual card on their phone, which they can use with Google Pay.

"Coinbase now becomes the first company to enable users to make mobile payments powered by their crypto balances," it stated.

According to an announcement, the new feature is currently available for users in 14 countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Norway, and Sweden. Coinbase also has plans to roll out Google Pay support to several other European countries later this year.

However, Coinbase customers may be loath to spend their Bitcoin after the price dropped in half against the US dollar over the last week.

Coinbase joins Visa as a principal member

Coinbase continues to improve the adoption of its Visa debit card. Back in February, Coinbase became the first cryptocurrency company to join Visa as a principal member.

This membership will allow Coinbase to offer additional features to Coinbase Card users, including support in more markets and additional features to improve the utility of the card. Likewise, it also allows Coinbase to issues its own debit cardsâ€”instead of relying on third parties as it currently does.
