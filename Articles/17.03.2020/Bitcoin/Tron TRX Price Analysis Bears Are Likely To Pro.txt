Tron Price Analysis

In the past few days, there was a significant decline in TRON price below the $0.0162 support level against the US Dollar. TRX price broke many crucial supports near $0.0120 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours) to enter a bearish zone.

The decline was such that the price even dived below the $0.0100 support area. Finally, the price traded below the $0.0880 support area and traded to a new 2020 low at $0.0070.

Recently, it started an upside correction and traded above the $0.0800 resistance level. There was a break above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the key decline from the $0.0153 high to $0.0070 low.

On the upside, there is a major resistance forming near the $0.0110 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.0110 on the 4-hours chart. Moreover, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the key decline from the $0.0153 high to $0.0070 low is near the $0.0110 level to act as a hurdle.

Therefore, it won’t be easy for tron buyers to lead the price above the $0.0110 resistance level. The next major resistance is near the $0.0120 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).

A successful close above the $0.0110 and $0.0120 resistance levels is needed for a trend change in the near term. Conversely, the price might struggle to gain pace above the $0.0110 resistance.

On the downside, an initial support is near the $0.0085 level, below which there is a risk of a sharp decline towards the $0.00700 level.

The chart indicates that TRX price is clearly trading in a bearish below the $0.0110 and $0.0120 resistance levels. As long as there is no recovery above $0.0120, the bears are likely to remain in control.
