It’s another week which means it’s time for another wrap up of the weekend’s blockchain and cryptocurrency news.

Let’s get to it.

1. South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb has been hacked for the third time in two years, reports ZDNet. Hackers are thought to have made off with around $19 million worth of cryptocurrency in EOS and XRP.

2. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a decision last Friday which will further delay a final ruling on the Bitwise and VanEck Bitcoin BTC ETFs, CoinDesk reports. The SEC now has until May 16 to make a decision on the proposals.

3. In a statement released over the weekend, TRON‘s founder, Justin Sun has vowed to support Japanese laws and is denouncing any gambling dapps on the platform that specifically target the Japanese market, Trustnodes reports.

4. Trading in unlicensed security tokens in Hong Kong is now likely to be a criminal offense. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission released a statement last week that declared “Security Tokens are likely to be ‘securities’… and so subject to the securities laws of Hong Kong.”

5. Japan‘s biggest rail travel operator is potentially eyeing Bitcoin as a payment option for its transport cards, Cointelegraph reports. There are no concrete plans as yet, but rail travelers could have the option to top-up their travel cards with cryptocurrency.
