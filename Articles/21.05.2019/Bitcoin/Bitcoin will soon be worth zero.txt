I wrote in my last column that bitcoin is really a bitcon. I’ve been telling you this since the price of this “investment” collapsed from around $20,000 to $4,000 last year.

Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, echoed a similar view last week but didn’t do it quite as colorfully.

Last Thursday night bitcoin crashed by about $1,000, to around $7,000.

Bitcoin will soon be worth zero. But until then criminals will still be able to use it and other digital currency to move money around the world without being caught.
