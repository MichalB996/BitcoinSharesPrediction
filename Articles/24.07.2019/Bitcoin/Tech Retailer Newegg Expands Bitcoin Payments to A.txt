Online electronics and software retail giant Newegg has expanded its bitcoin payments option to a host of new countries.

In an announcement on Wednesday, the U.S.-based firm said it will accept bitcoin in 73 additional of its country-specific stores. The news means that the cryptocurrency can be used to pay for purchases in nearly all of its 80 served nations.

The firm first started offering bitcoin payments back in July 2014, soon after expanding the option to Canada.

“Five years ago, we were one of the first major online shopping destinations to accept Bitcoin, and our early-adopter customers were quick to embrace this new payment option,” said Anthony Chow, Newegg President Global Sales.

Opening up the service to another 73 countries “underscores our commitment to bring innovation to the online shopping experience, and answers customers’ growing preference for our Bitcoin payment option.”

The bitcoin payments are made possible through Newegg’s partnership with blockchain payments provider BitPay.

Sonny Singh, chief commercial officer at BitPay, said in the announcement:

“Bitcoin allows users to send and receive money just as easy as sending an email, opening up opportunities for businesses and consumers globally as a secure, low-cost transactional option for the merchants. Newegg was among the first companies to see this opportunity and has continued to expand its Bitcoin acceptance to nearly all of its customers around the world.”

Newegg added that using BitPay allows it to increase its margin on each bitcoin transaction by avoiding credit card fees.
