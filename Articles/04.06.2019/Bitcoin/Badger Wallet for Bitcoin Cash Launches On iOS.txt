Bitcoin.com’s Badger Wallet, a bitcoin cash light client, launched a new app for iOS, marking its entry into mobile devices after success with desktop storage and trading.

Apple users, like the Chrome and Firefox clients before them, will be able to store, send, and receive BCH and other Simple Ledger Protocol tokens while using the application in a non-custodial manner.

Badger translated several of the functionalities from the desktop versions directly to mobile, such as keeping everything on-chain as well as maintaining full client control and custody over their bitcoin cash or SLP tokens.

Additionally, Badger maintained the option to send small amounts of funds between wallets. One test user wrote, “I… sent myself a nickel because it’s not possible to send such a small amount of satoshis on other networks”

Tokens can be sent worldwide instantly for about $.002 each, according a reddit post following the announcement.

Previous users of the service will be able to restore their existing Badger wallets using their 12-word seed phrase. The new app will automatically register their funds from their existing accounts.

The open source beta version is available in the App Store as an application available for iPhones, iPads, and the iPod Touch using iOS 9 or later.
