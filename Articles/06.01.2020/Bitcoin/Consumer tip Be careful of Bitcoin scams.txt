Bitcoin is a global virtual currency, consisting of a computer file stored in a digital wallet. It functions separately from regular banks, with direct user-to-user transactions recorded in a public list called the “blockchain.”

Bitcoin has now spawned numerous online scams. Some current scams involve online business opportunities and investments where you end up being paid in fake cryptocurrency. Additionally, there have been reports of Ponzi schemes, where the scammers offer bitcoin money with a guaranteed return in exchange for you depositing monetary funds into their account. Unfortunately, only early investors ever receive a return on their investments.

Bitcoin prize giveaways have also been used to trick people into turning over identifying info as part of a “registration” process. Scammers then use the info to impersonate you and access your online financial accounts. Never agree to meet someone in person to “receive” your bitcoin. This could result in your being robbed or injured.
