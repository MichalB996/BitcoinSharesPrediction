Nasdaq Inc. is still exploring a plan to sell bitcoin futures by bringing in an outside business partner, CEO Adena Friedman told Bloomberg.

"We have been working with the industry and with a great partner to look at whether or not it’s the right thing for us to do," she said. "I think we’re still evaluating that."

She said Nasdaq would have to self certify as a futures exchange for this and would also have to make sure from a financial risk management perspective the exchange was fully prepared.

She said that Nasdaq sees bitcoin futures have a role, but that bitcoin needed to still mature.
