Finman first learned about bitcoin from a "hippie" at a protest, and he thought it sounded promising.

In an interview with Cheddar, Finman shared the origin story of his discovery of bitcoin:

Finman said his older brother brought him to a protest following the financial crisis of 2008. He recalls running from the police and seeing a man wearing a bitcoin shirt, and then asking him what bitcoin was.

"He's like a hippie, he's like, 'Man, I think it's gonna end Wall Street, all the corruption, and all the bad things.'"

That prompted Finman to research the cryptocurrency himself and he decided, along with his brother, that it was the next big thing.
