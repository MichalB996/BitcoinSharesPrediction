The consumer research firm Comparitech has released an analysis of the overall sentiments expressed toward a number of crypto assets on Reddit.

After analyzing 48,000 Reddit posts, the study found that 85% of all sentiments across all cryptocurrencies are positive.

When it comes to which digital asset has the most positive sentiment overall, the surprising results show Facebook’s Libra earned the highest percentage of positive mentions. The results don’t necessarily mean that Crypto Reddit loves Libra, but could instead be a sign that crypto holders think the social media giant’s digital asset could boost the industry at large.

“The most positive discussions surrounded Libra. The new project, which looks to enable users to send Libra via Facebook-owned Messenger and WhatApp, renewed hype among Redditors. The majority – 98 percent – of the subreddits posts were positive.”

Libra is followed by Cardano, Ethereum, Tron, Litecoin, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple (XRP), Stellar and Tether.

Comparitech analyzed posts from January of 2017 through July of 2019.
