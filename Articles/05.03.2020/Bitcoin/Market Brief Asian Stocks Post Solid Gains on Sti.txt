Risk appetite pushed Asian stocks higher in this morning’s trading on optimism fueled by easing measures launched by central banks. The Nikkei 225 finished today’s trading 1.08% or 228.91 points higher at 21,328.90. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite Index posted a 1.99% or 60.011-point profit at 3,071.677. The Hang Seng Index also looks on track to finish with gains. As of this writing, it is up by 2.10% or 552.5 points at 26,775.8.

Yesterday, the HKMA and BOC announced cutting their official cash rates. Earlier this week, the RBA and Federal Reserve also lowered theirs. These efforts are expected to support the global economy as it is weighed down by the coronavirus outbreak. It also helps that reports coming out of China, the epicenter of the infection, suggest that conditions are improving. A handful of companies have gone, while others are working to get back into normal operations. The Chinese government has also announced that it would provide ample liquidity for the province of Hubei.

On the other hand, currencies are mixed in today’s trading. USDCAD leads gains at 0.14% after the BOC’s 50-point rate cut yesterday. It is followed by NZDUSD which is up by 0.11%. Meanwhile, AUDUSD is unchanged.
