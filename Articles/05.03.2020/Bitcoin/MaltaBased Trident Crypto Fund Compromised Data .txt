Malta-Based Trident Crypto Fund Compromised; Data of 266,000 Users Leaked

According to a report published by Russian media outlet Izvestia on March 5, 2020, Maltese Trident Crypto Fund has suffered a major data leak which is speculated to have compromised personal data of over 266,000 users registered with the platform.

Another Crypto Fund Compromised

In what is being reported as yet another hack attack in the crypto industry, personal data of close to 266,000 users of Malta-based Trident Crypto Fund has been compromised. Speaking to the Russian media outlet, Ashot Oganesyan, CTO of cybersecurity firm DeviceLock, said that the users’ data was posted on a number of file-sharing websites following the breach.

The CTO added that stolen data – including email addresses, mobile contacts, encrypted passwords, and IP addresses, was leaked on various file-sharing websites around February 20. Oganesyan added that on March 3, the hackers decrypted and published a dataset of close to 120,000 passwords.

Notably, Izvestia reached out to one of the individuals on the database who confirmed a connection to the Trident Crypto Fund. Surprisingly, however, the firm has no Internet footprint in that it has no presence on the web, including LinkedIn.

Suspicions regarding the legitimacy of the crypto fund are still up in the air as its still not established where the fund is registered or physically located. Data from Crypto Fund Research suggests that the fund is based in Malta. The fund also supposedly offers clients investment in a “top 10 crypto” index fund that is calculated by the platform itself.

Since the news came to light, the platform has made no official word pertaining to the data breach on its website or its Telegram group.

Will 2020 Continue the 2019 Hack Streak?

Close followers of the cryptocurrency industry remember the hack fest the year 2019 was. In November 2019, BTCManager reported how South Korean cryptocurrency exchange UpBit had suffered a serious hack which resulted in the loss of a total of $51 million worth of Ether (ETH).

In fact, merely three months into the year, 2020 has already witnessed its fair share of robust and methodical crypto exchange and platform hacks. BTCManager reported on January 8, 2020, hackers had breached the security of the U.K.-based currency exchange site Travelex.
