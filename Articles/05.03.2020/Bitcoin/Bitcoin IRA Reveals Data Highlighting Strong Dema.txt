Methodology

Data used for this report represents thousands of transactions made exclusively on the Bitcoin IRA 24/7 self-trading platform since launching in December 2018. A transaction is any single cryptocurrency that was purchased or liquidated on the Bitcoin IRA platform. For the purposes of this report, swaps were counted as two transactions, a purchase and a liquidation, and each cryptocurrency was counted as a separate transaction for orders with multiple cryptocurrencies in a single order. Actual transaction amounts and volumes were excluded from this report for consumer privacy.

In addition to this report, earlier this year the company announced reaching a milestone of $400 million in cryptocurrency transactions and enabling its self-directed clients to generate an average net return of 11.6%.

Chris Kline, COO, Bitcoin IRA said:

"This data represents our hard work and dedication in providing a secure, accurate, and high-quality platform for our clients that enables them to capitalize on the incredible growth of cryptocurrencies. Transaction volumes recently reached all-times highs and we expect that trend to continue through 2020 as the market matures and consumer adoption increases."
