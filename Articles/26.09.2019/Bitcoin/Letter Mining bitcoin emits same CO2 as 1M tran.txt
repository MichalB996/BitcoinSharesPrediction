‘Mining’ bitcoin emits same CO2

as 1M transatlantic flights

Bitcoin mining, an unnecessary and artificial industry, is an inexcusable source of CO2 emissions. Built into the definition of bitcoin (a cryptocurrency: book-entry virtual money) is a means of increasing supply of bitcoin, via a computation-intensive race to locate a hidden number, with the newly minted coin as the prize. Competing for that prize has spawned an entire industry.

Electric power, for the banks of computers dedicated to “mining” bitcoin, annually emits (according to Alex Hern’s Jan. 17, 2018, article in TheGuardian.com) CO2 commensurate with roughly 1 million transatlantic flights.

Letter: Trump’s recklessness with human lives is disgusting I challenge Congress and our electric power industry to stamp out this wasteful practice in the U.S. Sufficient international pressure might persuade the industry to issue new bitcoins by fiat, without emissions. Like the Federal Reserve.
