Braamfontein – Prophetess Mary Bushiri put fake news purveyors to shame yesterday morning in Johannesburg, South Africa, as she accompanied her husband, and leader of ECG Church, Shepherd Bushiri at the CRL Commission.

The prophetess, who had become a victim of fake news from several outlets in Malawi appeared unfazed and unmoved, as she struck a dignified figure next to her iconic husband.

Media reports in Malawi and South Africa, acting on rogue medical records were buzzing with reports that the prophetess had fallen ill and was on her death bed.

The reports came 2 days after the prophetess appeared next to her husband on consecutive days in Rustenburg, South Africa, for a partners meeting, and then a leaders service last weekend.

But the purveyors of fake news could not have been more ashamed, as Prophetess Mary, known affectionately as “Mum” appeared at the commission with her usual sparkle.

Dressed in a near floral attire, she held her husband’s hand as they walked in, and kept by his side as he delivered the most authentic account of ECG before the CRL Commission.

Speaking, with regards to the constant attacks via fake news, Prophet Bushiri told South Africa that his church had been a victim of speculation, while his media relations manager, Maynard Manyowa, said the church was a victim of “orchestrated misinformation” by both conventional media houses “who seek to ride on the name of the prophet” and bogus news websites “who use the prophets name for clickbait”.

The ECG church re-opens its services on the 3rd of February.
