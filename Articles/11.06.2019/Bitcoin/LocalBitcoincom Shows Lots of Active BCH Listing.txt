Local.Bitcoin.com Spreading Free Trade Everywhere

On June 4, in honor of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, Bitcoin.com launched our peer-to-peer BCH marketplace. Since then many individuals have executed trades on our new platform and so far the platform has gathered close to 14,000 account signups. Preliminary statistics show traders are from all around the world and you can find someone selling bitcoin cash throughout many countries and cities.

For instance, bitcoin cash fans are excited to observe multiple traders offering to buy and sell BCH in Venezuela. Venezuelan citizens have been battling a rough economy and hyperinflation for a very long time and the sovereign bolivar is practically worthless. BCH supporters discussed the subject after seeing that Venezuelan traders are starting to post buy and sell orders, while some have already executed a few trades. On Reddit forum r/btc, one person remarked:

Trading in Venezuela is great to see and it is the place in the world that needs the most economical sovereignty/freedom to escape hyperinflation ‚Äî That can literally save lives.

A decent portion of traders are from within the U.S. and browsing various listings posted from multiple cities shows a number of American traders have fulfilled a number of BCH swaps. Trades have been carried out using gift cards and cash, and one trader has figured out how to swap crypto for crypto on Local.Bitcoin.com‚Äôs platform. The user dubbed ‚ÄúShapeshift‚Äù has executed some trades by allowing people to swap crypto assets privately for bitcoin cash. With all the discussion taking place in regard to India‚Äôs crypto regulation lately, there‚Äôs a decent number of Local.Bitcoin.com traders from India. They have already carried out successful trades and people are offering trades with IMPS, Paytm, as well as cash. Browsing Local.Bitcoin.com‚Äôs listings shows there are quite a bit of offers available in Nigeria with all types of payment choices. Gift cards, cash deposit, bank transfers, and Western Union exchanges are popular among Nigerians.

Local.Bitcoin.com visitors can find a slew of traders in Indonesia, the Philippines, Canada, Uganda, and Russia. For ‚Äúin person‚Äù cash trades, there‚Äôs a wide variety of buyers and sellers utilizing this option on the BCH marketplace. Browsing the ‚Äúany payment method‚Äù option opens up a greater variety of offers that can be used to trade without having to meet someone.
