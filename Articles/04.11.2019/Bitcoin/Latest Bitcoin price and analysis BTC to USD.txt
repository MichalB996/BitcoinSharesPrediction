Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at just below $9,200 and has managed to form a strong level of support following last week’s 40% spike in price.

BTC has hardly moved over the past 24 hours but is down about 3.2% since last week.

Bitcoin has been consolidating since last week after price spiked from $7,500 to over $10,000 before retracing to the $9,000 range.

Following a number of lower highs, Bitcoin now seems to be in a confirmed uptrend, with price now above all its EMAs.

Will BTC recover back to $10,000 and above soon?

Let’s take a look at Bitcoin’s chart.

As you can see from the chart above, BTC is now back trading above all its EMAs – something that hasn’t happened since September. In addition, all the EMAs are now moving in an upwards direction, which means we should expect BTC to hold at least above $8,500 where the 200-day EMA is currently sitting.

Last week, I said I expected Bitcoin to bounce to around $10,000 soon, and I still personally believe that will happen. After last week’s massive pump, it’s clear new investors and traders are taking over price action.

The current Bitcoin trend

History shows us that BTC is prone to huge drops between 30% and 40% during bull seasons. Therefore, I don’t advise that you fight the trend, but surf it for as long as possible.

Last week, I underlined that within the next three to five weeks, we could see a major reversal after a period of serious accumulation by ‘hodlers’.

However, for the time being, not only has Bitcoin reversed its downwards trend, I argue BTC will reach $12,000 by the end of 2019 if we continue to see strong gains.

Volume, which had dropped from a peak of $27 billion earlier in the year to just over $15 billion last week, is now back to the $20 billion range.

Bitcoin’s market dominance has also slightly increased about 1% since early October, from 66.5% to 67.3%.

As veteran traders and investors usually say, smart money “buys when there’s blood on the streets”. Currently, I’m waiting for another minor drop in price to make new entries. These drops won’t last forever, and if you think traditional markets are currently on a massive bull run, I wouldn’t be so sure the trend won’t reverse.

How can the markets not push higher throughout the year after the ECB’s recent rate cuts, the continuous share buybacks from huge corporations, or the inverted bond yield shoving investors away towards riskier assets?

In addition, repo market activity – as in loans from central banks to commercial and investment banks – has spiked to new monthly records. That adds up to another signal of weakness among most banks.

About Bitcoin

In August 2008, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered. On 31st October 2008, a paper was published called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. This was authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. To date, no one knows who this person, or people, are.

The paper outlined a method of using a P2P network for electronic transactions without “relying on trust”. On 3rd January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence. Nakamoto mined block number “0” (or the “genesis block”), which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins.
