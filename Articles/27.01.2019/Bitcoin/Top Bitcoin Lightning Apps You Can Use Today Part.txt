Bitcoin Technology Top Bitcoin Lightning Apps You Can Use Today (Part 2)

So we continue our journey into the wonderful (and sometimes weird) world of Lightning Apps (LApps). And as a testament to how far the market has come, my quick ‚Äòlisticle‚Äô has morphed into a two-part behemoth.

If you haven‚Äôt already, then check out Part 1, covering wallets, marketplaces, content monetization, and tip jars. If you have, then let‚Äôs get on with the ride.

Messaging via Lightning Network

International SMS messages cost a small fortune, but with Insms, the price comes down to that of a small lightning transaction. Ideal for anonymously stalking someone in another country. Or, if you need to receive an SMS, but don‚Äôt want to reveal your mobile number, Receive SMS has you covered. Temporary numbers to receive messages are currently available only in the US, with more countries coming soon.

But if you think terrestrial messaging is just a little pass√©, why not send a message via satellite.

I've written a tool to relay messages via the @Blockstream satellite. Data rate is charged through lightning network. ‚ö°Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüì° https://t.co/FJnMYmpGtI pic.twitter.com/bzuERkEWFJ ‚Äî RideTheLightning‚ö°Ô∏è (@MediumSqueeze) January 26, 2019

Gaming and Gambling

Hammerland is a MineCraft lookalike MMORPG, using lightning for in-game payments (and rewards). Or if you prefer your MineCraft to be more‚Ä¶ MineCraft, then BitQuest is the first MineCraft server denominated in cryptocurrency.

For those who prefer to expound less effort to gain (or lose) their bitcoin, there are a wealth of ways to gamble away your money with Lightning. Lightning Spin is a simple ‚Äòwheel of fortune‚Äô-type game where sending an LN payment feels like you‚Äôre putting in a quarter into an arcade.

Meanwhile, Lightning Roulette is‚Ä¶ well, a full-blown game of roulette.

Alternatively, depending on your preference, you can bet on Three-Card Monte. Although sadly the implementation of Thunder Dice, no longer seems to be active.

Setting Up Shop

There are several ways of accepting Lightning payments at your online store. Strike is one of the best and easiest to use, taking a flat 1% fee on all transactions, and offering unlimited free daily withdrawals.

Or if your establishment is a bit less virtual, and almost entirely more ‚Äòbrick and mortar‚Äô, then you can use nanopos. This simple Lightning Point-of-Sale system works best with stores selling fixed-price items, although it also offers a custom price option. So your customers can now use LN payments to buy coffee, beanies, a hat-stand, comedy tickets, ticker tape, audio cassettes, hearing aids, condoms‚Ä¶

Speaking of random stuff.

Random Stuff

Unleash your inner artist (or just scrawl obscenities on somebody else‚Äôs artwork) at Satoshi‚Äôs Place, where you can endlessly paint over as many pixels as you can pay for.

Buy a virtual coffee at StarBlocks; Listen to music on Lightning Jukebox; Set up a Twitter-bot to get paid for likes, retweets, and follows.

Or just exchange your cryptocurrencies in seconds for low fees at Shapeshift-esque ZigZag, and hunker down behind TorGuard‚Äòs VPN.

Oh‚Ä¶ then wait to see what amazing abilities LApps bring us in the future.
