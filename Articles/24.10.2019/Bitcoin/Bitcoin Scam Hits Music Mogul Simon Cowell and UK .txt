Three UK celebrities are pushing back against a fake article touting their supposed endorsement of a Bitcoin trading platform.

The article claims that famous English broadcaster Jeremy Clarkson, talent show judge Simon Cowell and British business magnate Alan Sugar have made large sums of money by using a trading platform called “Bitcoin Revolution.”

According to the British media outlet This is Money, the fake article tells the story of a bride who told her groom that she’d become a millionaire after discovering an automated Bitcoin trading platform. The article appears as though it was published on ITV’s website.

It also claims that Clarkson, Cowell and Sugar all profited from an online Bitcoin investment scheme.

The following quote is attributed to Clarkson.

“Bitcoin Revolution has been the greatest investment I’ve ever made! … my Bitcoin trading profits have increased by 320%.”

According to This is Money,

“When we contacted the Grand Tour host and ex-Top Gear star, he told This is Money: ‘I have absolutely no knowledge of this company. It is a scam.”

“…neither the host of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, nor the star of The Apprentice, or the top judge on The X-Factor are really backing this scam, which This is Money was alerted to by a reader who had read it online.”

Says Clarkson,

“I have absolutely no knowledge of this company. It is a scam. I’ve engaged the services of a lawyer to deal with this. And will now go online to see what a ‘bitcoin’ is.”

Last month, Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet was targeted to pimp a fake cryptocurrency dubbed “Bitcoin Code.”
