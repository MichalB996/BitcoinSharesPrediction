Steam has seen a massive surge of online gaming activity amid the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) across the globe. While people are staying at home, gaming seems to be the most entertaining option to go with.

On March 14, Steam achieved an all-time record of over 20 million players online in a 24-hour period. Among those 20 million, 6.2 million users were actively playing games.

The last highest in-game players were recorded back in January 2018 when almost 18 million users were online. The current record surpasses the existing one by a whopping 200,000 users.

As per SteamDB’s twitter update, the exact number of users was 20,313,451 at around 13:25 GMT, on Saturday, March 14.

The COVID-19 pandemic is apparently the main reason that Steam has seen such a major uplift last weekend, as more people around the world are staying at home for quarantine. Recently, an Italian ISP reported a 70% increase in traffic with a major jump in Fortnite game players.

The games played on the online network included Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which remains the most popular game and hitting all-time highs of 1,024,845 players. This was followed by Dota 2, with over 701,632 players. Other popular games played, among many others, were Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds and GTA V.

Online gaming may continue to surge as pandemic rises

As the coronavirus has impacted the world beyond limits and with no signs of slowing down, Steam is likely to see many more players coming to its network.

To date, there are over 198,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with China, Italy, Iran, and Spain topping the charts with the most number of cases.
