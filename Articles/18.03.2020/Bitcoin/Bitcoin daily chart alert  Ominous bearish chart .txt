(Kitco News) - Bitcoin-U.S. dollar prices are lower in early U.S. trading Wednesday. Bulls are failing to stabilize prices in an environment where “sell what you can” is still prevalent among panicked traders and investors. Bitcoin bears are in solid near-term technical control amid a price downtrend in place on the daily bar chart. A bearish pennant pattern has formed on the daily bar chart, to suggest more price pressure in the near term. By Jim Wyckoff For Kitco News Follow @jimwyckoff www.kitco.com
