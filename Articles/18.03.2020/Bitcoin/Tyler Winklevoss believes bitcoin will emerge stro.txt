The Winklevoss twin believes that the leading cryptocurrency’s significance will outperform the current negative sentiment, and it will emerge stronger than ever. Last week, bitcoin witnessed one of the worst days in its history since 2013. The price of the leading cryptocurrency dropped to as low as $3,600. However Tyler Winklevoss is optimistic about the bitcoin’s future.

Bitcoin continues to hover around $5,000 mark.

At the time of writing, the price of the leading cryptocurrency is trading just above $5,200. In a time of crisis, Tyler Winklevoss is optimistic about the future of bitcoin. He tweeted that bitcoin was born in 2008, during the winter of our financial discontent. It has already weathered much to be here, and it seems unlikely to give up anytime soon. It will emerge from this current calamity stronger than ever. Decades are not measured in days, he added.

Gemini co-founder is not the only one optimistic about bitcoin’s future.

Tyler Winklevoss is not the only one who believes bitcoin will emerge stronger once the world recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. Tim Draper earlier said that once the world comes back, it will be bitcoin and not banks that will save the day. The former NSA agent and the online privacy advocate Edward Snowden also thought that the recent fall in the bitcoin was too much panic and too little reason.
