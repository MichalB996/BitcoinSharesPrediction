OpenNode, a bitcoin (BTC) payment processing platform, has now announced the addition of invoices. Users can instantly send bills with professional, itemized invoices; easily created within the platform. Invoices also allow merchants to include tax rates, discounts and specify issue dates and due dates.

“With our new invoice feature, you can now bill clients and customers with the peace of mind that the invoice amount due won’t fluctuate with bitcoin price volatility. That’s because the Payment Request associated with the invoice calculates the bitcoin amount due when your customer clicks the “Pay invoice” button. From there, they will be directed to a standard Bitcoin/Lightning Network checkout.”
