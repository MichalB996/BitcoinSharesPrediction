The Aston Martin Valkyries will not be taking part in the WEC racing series, but it made its way to public roads for the first time. Aston Martin shared some images of the public road testing adventure of the Valkyrie.

Aston has released a bunch of photos of the car driving on UK roads as public highways testing commences.

On a public road where all the mundane things are, the Valkyrie looks out of this world. In some of the pictures posted by the carmaker company itself, Valkyrie is placed among cars from other production shows that it is about half their height. When it comes to the length or the width of the car, it is almost the same as the cars from other products, such as the Hyundai Kona.

The Valkyrie is powered by a Cosworth-built, 6.5-liter naturally-aspirated V12. It runs of this hybrid system, and Rimac supplied some of its components. The total output of this car is 1160bhp. The car is expected to make at least 1,000 horsepower and rev to over 11,000 rpm.

Let us not forget that Valkyrie is not a racing car, and made for public roads, hence it will be street legal, however, not when it is equipped with the track package or if it’s the 1,100 horsepower AMR Pro variant.

Red Bull Advanced Technologies will undertake a chuck of the car’s development. The Valkyrie was set to race in the ACO’s new ‘Hypercar Class’ at Le Mans. However, it is highly likely that it will take place, especially since Aston postpone its entry as it “considers whether to continue in any future prototype class”.

The car manufacturer is still thinking about delivering Valkyries to its customers in the second half of this year. The carmaker has not put a precise date on it.
