Coinbase and Google are teaming up. According to a new post from the US-based exchange, Coinbase Card users can now work directly with Google Pay.

This is now the first time cryptocurrency enthusiasts can utilize their assets with a mobile payment like Google or Apple Pay.

“From today, Coinbase Card payments using Google Pay are available to customers in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Finland, France, Italy, Slovakia, Spain, Croatia, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. We are working to expand to other European countries later this year,” the post notes.

Note that Apple Pay is not available just yet – this is only available on Android devices for now. Though we can be sure Apple support will be coming soon.

“Google Pay gives Coinbase Card customers a fast, secure way to pay using their smartphones, smartwatches, and other Google Pay-enabled devices. With Google Pay, Android users can pay for everything from daily travel to end-of-year getaways using their crypto in the safest possible way.”

As you may know, Coinbase Card released in April of last year though only in European countries. The card now supports Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Stellar, and more.

Recently, Coinbase has been sending its employees to work from home due to the Coronavirus outbreak. The group is also losing some of its key executives lately.
