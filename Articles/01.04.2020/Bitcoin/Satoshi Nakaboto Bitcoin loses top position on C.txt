Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin BTC every fucking day.

Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Hannah Arendt used to say: I got the horses in the back.

Bitcoin price

We closed the day, March 31 2020, at a price of $6,438. That’s a minor 0.12 percent increase in 24 hours, or $8. It was the highest closing price in three days.

We’re still 67 percent below Bitcoin’s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).

Bitcoin market cap

Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $117,814,077,267. It now commands 66 percent of the total crypto market.

Bitcoin volume

Yesterday’s volume of $32,786,468,812 was the lowest in one day, 58 percent above last year’s average, and 55 percent below last year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 640 tons of gold.

Bitcoin transactions

A total of 290,068 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 10 percent below last year’s average and 35 percent below last year’s high.

Bitcoin transaction fee

Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.26. That’s $3.45 below last year’s high of $3.71.

Bitcoin distribution by address

As of now, there are 9,947 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.8 percent of the total supply, the top 100 15.2 percent, and the top 1000 35.2 percent.

Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin

With a market capitalization of $117 billion, NextEra Energy has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.

Bitcoin’s path towards $1 million

On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.

He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 97.5 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin’s price should have been $264,993 by now, according to dickline.info.

Bitcoin Energy Consumption

Bitcoin used an estimated 193 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 70 terawatt hour. That’s the equivalent of Colombia’s energy consumption or 6,5 million US households. Bitcoin’s energy consumption now represents 0.3% of the whole world’s electricity use.

Bitcoin on Twitter

Yesterday 24,944 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 33.4 percent above last year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day last year about Bitcoin was 75,543.
