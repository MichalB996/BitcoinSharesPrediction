Covid19: disaster or blessing?

The main reason for such a recession in the first quarter of 2020 is the global COVID-19 pandemic. It has dug a deep hole in the cryptocurrency market and the global economy as a whole, and even analysts aren't sure where the market would go next.

However, there are definitely some signs that could indicate future growth. First, there is a global trend to use digital money instead of cash. According to coinidol.com, a global blockchain news agency, this can even lead to a general cut in Fiat money in circulation, paving the way for cryptocurrency.

In addition, some experts, including John McAfee, believe that the world could face a significant depreciation of the dollar due to the recent coronavirus discharge package, which injects a $ 2 trillion injection from the Federal Reserve Fund. The Fed also printed another $ 6 trillion to Fiat due to continued poor performance in other markets and low stock trading volume.

Both of these factors could cause loss of confidence in traditional assets and force investors to look for alternatives that could also have a positive impact on the cryptocurrency as the market will see an influx of investments. Even now, trading on a variety of cryptocurrency exchanges has increased as the ecosystem has continued to take into account and believed that Bitcoin is indeed a safe asset for safe havens.
