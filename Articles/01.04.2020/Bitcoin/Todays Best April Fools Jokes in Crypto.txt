April Fool’s Day was not lost on the cryptocurrency community. Jokes poured in from near and far as market participants welcomed some levity during an otherwise frightening time.

If you weren’t careful, it was simple to get caught up in the pranks and truly believe that CoinMarketCap had added a Toilet Paper Token, for instance. Pranksters came out of the woodwork, ranging from Bitcoin BUY NOW maximalists picking on rival networks to blockchain startups launching fake products, not to mention shots fired at Satoshi Nakamoto-wannabe Craig Wright. There are too many to count, so we thought we would compile a list of the top crypto-fueled April Fool’s jokes of the day.

Toilet Paper

Let’s start with the one that appears to have started it all — CoinMarketCap’s Toilet Paper Token. The cryptocurrency market data company, which has been receiving a lot of media attention lately, said it rolled out a new coin, dubbed the Toilet Paper Token, even suggesting that the coin muscled Bitcoin out of the way as the No. 1 cryptocurrency on the list with a market cap of $41 billion. Not to be outdone by its own cleverness, the team behind CMC also channeled their inner ICO with a Toilet Paper Wipe Paper, for which there is a blog dedicated.

It’s clearly a play on the scarcity of the toilet paper supply during the COVID-19 crisis combined with the inflation Most people who know anything about the economy have heard the word inflation. It is usually thrown around as a... More model of cryptocurrencies. CMC seems to have struck a chord with the cryptocurrency community, based on the dozens of replies to its post.

Craig Wright

What would April Fools’ Day be without a Craig Wright/Satoshi joke? The team over at Trust Crypto Wallet A crypto wallet is a device or app that stores digital assets. Unlike the physical wallet in your back pocket,... More has us covered, announcing to its Twitter followers that “Craig Wright has been confirmed as Satoshi Nakamoto” before letting the cat out of the bag that it was a joke. The tweet was met with laughter and suggestions that a better joke might be to suggest that Craig Wright admitted he’s not Bitcoin’s creator.

Bull Market

Twitter account “StopAndDecrypt” couldn’t let the opportunity go by without crashing the party for Bitcoin bulls. While much of the cryptocurrency community is waiting for another 2017-like bull run in the Bitcoin price, especially with the halving event weeks away, StopAndDecrypt teased that it was all a joke. The cryptocurrency community didn’t seem to find any humor in it for some reason.
