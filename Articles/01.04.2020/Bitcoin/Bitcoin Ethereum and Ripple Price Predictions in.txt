Today, we will be looking at some of the historical price trends and market opinions in order to come up with price predictions for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple in April 2020.

Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analysis

After the huge crash from March 12-13th, Bitcoin mostly maintained itself between $4,000 and $5,000 until March 18th.

Between 19-23 March, Bitcoin has shown signs of a bullish recovery, which forced a breakout to the upside. The coin traded mostly above $6,000, but the bulls were struggling to get to on one key resistance of $7,000.

On March 20th, BTC/USD went from $5,500 to a high of $6.844,26, which almost touched the $7,000 resistance. However, the weekend price movement was dull, and buyers lost their momentum because of the increased bearish action. The immediate support values are set at $6,000 and $5,800. Bitcoin is currently struggling to hit a reversal targeting $7,000.

The current price of BTC is $6,329.29, with a 2.07% decrease over the past 24 hours.

Ethereum Price Prediction: Analysis

ETH also was affected on March 13th, with the coin going below the $100 mark, after starting the month at $200. The coin swiftly recovered that day and managed to keep itself above the $110 level.

ETH/USD is showing a strong bullish trend on intraday charts, like most of the crypto market. On March 19th, ETH went from $114 to $136,59 and continued to trade between $120 and $130 for the rest of the days until March 23rd.

The crypto is now trading above the $132 resistance but encounters major resistance near the $138 and $140 levels.

The ETH/USD pair is experiencing a strong growth ahead, as a 95 percent move against Bitcoin is expected by an analyst.

“ETH/USD dropped to $119.36 during early Asian hours before recovering to $133.10. The-second largest digital asset stayed mostly unchanged on a day-to-day basis and gained over 8% since the beginning of the day, moving in sync with the market. The bullish sentiments helped the coin to settle above SMA50 1-hour and smashed SMA100 at $132.50.”

The one-hour RSI is pointing upwards, which might signal that the downside correction has ceased for now.

Ripple Price Prediction: Analysis

Ripple recovered somewhat in the middle of the month of March, but since then, it remained in a consolidation mode, facing difficulties in breaking above the $0.174 level.

The coin experienced a series of higher lows around $0.11 (March 13st), followed by $0.13 (March 16th) and $0.15 (March 21), respectively. This indicates the forming of a healthy bullish pattern.

After trading above $0.20, on March 12, Ripple (XRP) dropped to a low of $0.13 and continued consolidation. The coin is currently experiencing a sideways trend, fluctuating $0.12 and $0.17. The bears have tested the lower price range but pulled back just like the bulls who tested the upper price range and also met resistance.

The major support level is currently set at $0.15 and $0.141, and if the coin does not keep itself above these levels, the price is likely to drop back to $0.11 support, from where Ripple began its recovery. The next support level is set at $0.1283 (March 16 low).

The first major resistance is set at $0.161 level, with $0.1700 being the most coveted one for a bullish rally, if the coin manages to reach $0.171, then this could trigger the increase of the price outside the recent consolidation channel and start targeting $0.2000.

Today, Ripple is trading at a price of $0.172232, with an increase of 2,74% in the past 24-hour period.
