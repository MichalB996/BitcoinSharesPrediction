Bitcoin Price Analysis

In the past few days, there was a decent upward move in bitcoin price above the $5,800 resistance against the US Dollar. BTC even settled nicely above the $6,000 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).

The last swing high was formed near $6,972 before the price corrected lower below $6,500. It traded as low as $5,859 and recently started an upside correction. There was a break above the $6,000 and $6,200 resistance levels.

Besides, there was a break above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $6,972 high to $5,859 low. The price even traded above the $6,400 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).

However, it struggled to gain momentum above the $6,500 and $6,580 resistance levels. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $6,500 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair.

The 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $6,972 high to $5,859 low is also acting as a resistance. Therefore, an upside break above the $5,500 and $5,580 resistance levels is needed for a strong rise towards the $7,000 and $7,200 levels.

On the downside, an initial support is near the $6,120 level. The main support is near the $6,000 level and the triangle lower trend line. If the price fails to stay above the $6,000 support, it could revisit the $5,859 low. Any further losses could open the doors for more downsides towards the $5,500 level.

Looking at the chart, bitcoin price is trading in a broad range above the $6,000 support. The bulls need to gain strength above $6,500 and $6,580 for upside continuation. If not, it could revisit the $5,859 low.
