Journalist and author Jake Adelstein: ‘Bitcoin quickly turned into a currency for criminals’

It is a story of one of the biggest robberies of all time: The search for a mystery genius who may not even exist, and the tale of a mastermind incarcerated by the ruthless reputation of the Japanese judicial system. The latest book by the Tokyo-based American journalist Jake Adelstein delves into the murky background of Bitcoin and shows how it quickly, as he describes it to us, became a currency for criminals and malcontents – a way to buy drugs on the internet anonymously.
