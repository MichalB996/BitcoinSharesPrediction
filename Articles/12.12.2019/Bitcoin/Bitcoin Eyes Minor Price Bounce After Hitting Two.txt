Bitcoin has fallen to two-week lows near $7,070.

Intraday charts suggest scope for a minor bounce to $7,300.

A UTC close above $7,870 is needed to confirm a short-term bullish reversal.

Acceptance below support at $7,087 would bolster the short-term bearish setup and open the doors for a re-test of recent lows near $6,500.

Bitcoin has potential for a small price bounce after hitting two-week lows early on Thursday.

The top cryptocurrency by market value fell to a two-week low of $7,072 during the Asian trading hours and was last seen changing hands at $7,160 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.8 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.

The week began on a negative note with the cryptocurrency registering a 2.4 percent drop on Monday after facing strong rejection above $7,600.

Since then, the bulls have struggled to make their presence felt despite the weekly chart flashing a golden crossover, a bull cross of the 50- and 100-week averages, for the first time since 2016.

The lagging indicatorâ€™s failure to attract buyers is not surprising, given the overall market conditions are currently bearish.

The cryptocurrency has been charting lower highs and lower lows since topping out at $13,880 in June and is currently down more than 45 percent from that level. The short-term technical studies are also biased bearish.

However, intraday charts are reporting seller exhaustion. So, a minor bounce could be seen before a potential deeper sell-off.

Hourly and 4-hour charts

The long-tail attached to the previous hourly candle (above left) is signaling seller exhaustion.

On the 4-hour chart, the RSI is creating higher lows, contradicting the slow drop in prices. That bullish divergence is signaling scope for a price bounce.

Backing that up, the 4-hour chart's MACD histogram is printing shallow bars below the zero line, a sign of weakening of bearish momentum.

Bitcoin may rise to the 10-day MA at $7,336 in the next few hours. The short-term outlook would turn bullish only above $7,870, though.

Daily chart

A UTC close above the Nov. 29 high of $7,870 would invalidate the lower-highs setup and confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.

Currently, that looks unlikely with the MACD histogram printing lower highs above the zero line, confirming the recent drop from highs above $7,600.

The 14-day relative strength index is hovering in bearish territory below 50, having violated an ascending trendline earlier this week.

A break below the immediate support at $7,087, if confirmed, would bolster the bearish setup and open the doors for a re-test of recent lows near $6,500.
