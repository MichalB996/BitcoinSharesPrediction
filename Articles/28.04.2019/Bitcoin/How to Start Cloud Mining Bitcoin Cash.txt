Cloud Mining With Bitcoin.com

Cloud mining is a way to generate cryptocurrency that doesn’t require buying any expensive equipment, or setting up the infrastructure needed for it. All you have to do is find a provider that you trust and buy a contract from them, which is in essence renting hash power in a dedicated facility. The Bitcoin.com Pool is one such provider, focusing on bitcoin cash (BCH) and employing one of the largest mining data centers in North America. The service also offers BTC cloud mining options and if you already have your own mining hardware you can connect it to the pool as well.

The Bitcoin.com Pool offers a selection of contract lengths, starting from just one month and running up to three years. This latter plan is currently sold out but there is a waiting list that applicants can join. The service also includes an app for Android and iOS mobile devices, so you can keep track of earnings, hashrate, and other statistics related to your contracts right on your phone.
