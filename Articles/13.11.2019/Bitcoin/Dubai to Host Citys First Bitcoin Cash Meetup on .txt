First Bitcoin Cash Meetup in Dubai

Bitcoin Cash Dubai, a local group for electronic cash supporters from the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates, is going to host its first meetup this Saturday, November 16. The event will take place at The Garden at McGettian’s in Bonnington Jumeirah Lakes Towers, starting at 7PM local time. The plan is for attendees to learn about bitcoin cash, while also enjoying a game of pool, lounging in the outdoor beer garden or dancing to music from top international bands. You can sign up for the meetup here. In attendance at the Dubai event will be Bitcoin.com’s Chief Operating Officer Mate Tokay.

The UAE has aspirations for Dubai to become one of the foremost international hubs for finance, so it must keep up with the rapid technological changes taking place across the world such as the digital asset revolution. In April 2018, the government launched the Emirates Blockchain Strategy 2021, a plan that aims to capitalize on the technology to transform 50% of government transactions. And in September 2018, the securities and commodities regulator in the UAE approved a plan to adopt comprehensive regulations for crowdfunding through the issuance of blockchain-based securities tokens.

“Dubai is looking to a big player in blockchain going forward and we at the bitcoin cash community will be at the forefront,” commented one of the upcoming meetup organizers.

How to Find or Create Your Own Bitcoin Cash Meetup
