8th of January 2020 – The advancements in the IT industry allowed for banking methods like Bitcoin to thrive in the online casino market, offering online casino goers the possibility to make their deposits in the most convenient way without the risk of exposing any of their financial information to unwanted third parties. Having reinvented the way we look at money transactions on the web, cryptocurrency has left the realm of “taboo” and became a trend.

There are many upsides to Bitcoin gambling. For one, players can gamble without being required to pay additional fees. Furthermore, they will rarely, if ever, face payment delays and the level of privacy is as high as it gets in a web-powered environment. Perhaps the biggest motive for online casino users to switch to cryptocurrency payments is anonymity. Whether a player chooses and exclusive BTC casino or a hybrid one, not the slightest details of his/her identity and transaction will ever be made known.

At Bestecasinobonussen.nl, casino enthusiasts are able to find useful and interesting info on online casino, sports betting sites, online poker rooms, casino games and also read current news and articles from the world of online gambling. Bestecasinobonussen.nl dedicates a special section to Bitcoin casinos, covering all the important questions a beginner Bitcoin gambler may have – how to gamble at a Bitcoin casino, why gamble using digital currency, the differences between Bitcoin casino operators, depositing and withdrawing with BTC, as well as what is Bitcoin – for those who are absolute novices and need a comprehensive introduction.

Bitcoin casinos are those that let players use a type of electronic cash known as a cryptocurrency to fund their gambling accounts. This means of payment is not administrated by any bank. Instead, it is sent from peer to peer and created through a process called “mining”. Bitcoin was invented in 2009 by a mysterious individual or group called Satoshi Nakamoto. Controversial at first, Bitcoin slowly found its proper use, making it easier for people to buy products and services online. Bestecasinobonussen.nl keeps up with the rising emergence of Bitcoin casinos, pointing out good and legal sites to play at.
