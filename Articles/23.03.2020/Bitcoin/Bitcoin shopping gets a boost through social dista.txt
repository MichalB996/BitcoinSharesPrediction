Since the fear of the corona virus causes many to stay indoors, which largely disrupts the larger economy, some digital sectors see this as a blessing.

State-imposed quarantines, decisions to distance themselves and measures to work from home have led to this Increase in screen time Use and online shopping. Earlier this week major retail outlets like Walmart and Amazon said they were having trouble keeping up with the demand from panic buyers. reported CNBC.

This increase in standby purchase is also spreading to the crypto sector, leading to unprecedented growth for a number of crypto payment processors.

Lolli, a Bitcoin reward application, reports doubling sales "from retailers supplying groceries and essentials like Safeway and Vitacost," said Aubrey Strobel, head of communications for the company, in a direct message.

“The majority of Lolli dealers are online. As a result, our sales have increased dramatically in response to the pandemic in the past few weeks, ”she said. "We expect this to continue over the next few weeks as employees move to a remote work schedule and prepare for COVID-19."

Lolli's partner, Safeway, operates 894 sites in 17 states, including California and Washington, that develop epicentres for the virus. Lolli, which rewards online customers in Satoshis, also has agreements with Postmates and Caviar for the delivery of restaurants, as well as with PetSmart, which offers a pet food delivery service.

Strike by Zap, a flash implementation currently in beta, was almost closed after payments went above expectations. Zap Mall CEO Jack Mallers said the wallet "passed its all-time highs last week" after processing Bitcoin-worth transactions.

It is a rally from Latin America to South Korea.

Mallers said the startup, which started in late January, is expecting transactions worth around Bitcoin per month.

“We weren't ready to make that much volume. I had to make emergency calls to our trading partners to make sure the app didn't crash, ”said Mallers.

Strike converts and settles Bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants, so retail stores never have to “touch” the asset. This means that Strike is "inherently short Bitcoin" for every payment made through the app. Using live trading algorithms to keep exposure constant, Mallers set automatic credit limits with their OTC desks to cover those short positions that, if exceeded, would prevent users from completing their transactions.

"These are people who stock up and buy gift cards for Walmart and CVS," said Mallers. He added that the rise "contextually related to coronavirus is related to [market] volatility".

"If Bitcoin's volatility tends to increase, people may increase their spending – people who create wealth tend to spend it – but the opposite is usually not the case," he said.

Fold, another startup for crypto payments with flash integration, has encountered inventory problems since FebruaryWill Reeves, CEO of Fold, said. "Most of the activity focused on preparation," he said. Many users have stocked up on websites like Amazon, Lowes and Cabela's with first aid and other accessories.

He added: “Some users mentioned that the contactless nature of fold payments compared to contaminated physical cash and credit cards made them do it feel safer for the first time."

ZenGo, a company based in Tel Aviv Wallet start According to customer boss Oriel Ohayon, the company has had a record number of customers in 70 countries who buy crypto and use it for transfers.

The increase in users "started earlier this week," he said. However, Ohayon is not sure that this is caused by the corona virus or is part of a growth trend that started in January.

Nonetheless, transactions with the untrusted wallet increased 300 percent from week to week, Ohayon said. "We don't know where and how funds are sent, but we have the feeling through support [tickets] and others that people are using it to store Bitcoin and send transfers."

"It's a rally from South Latin America to South Korea," said Ohayon. "I think there is a global pattern here."

Sergej Kotliar, CEO of Bitrefill, another popular payment channel without a custody account, said: "It is very difficult for us to notice a trend [in panic buying], especially with scientific knowledge."

Other crypto payment channels can also experience an upswing, though their privacy and distributed attributes make it impossible to determine. Like Mallers & # 39; other lightning implementation, Zap, which cannot track transactions.

"A bigger impact on us than people sitting at home is the volatility of the Bitcoin price," said Kotiar. A drop in Bitcoin price has historically led to a temporary increase in transactions. However, according to Kotiar, app usage will weaken if prices remain depressed after this initial surge in transactions.

"People spend significantly less on purchases when Bitcoin is low," he said.

Likewise, BTCPay, a payment processor touted for its secure, private, and censorship-resistant features, has likely seen an outbreak of user activity, but its founders cannot confirm this.

"BTCPay is self-hosted software and we do not collect data about users or their transactions," said Pavlenex, a pseudonymous BTCPay employee.

Strobel, communications director at Lolli, is a blessing for her startup and reminds users: "Nobody knows how long this pandemic will last and how the micro and macro effects will impact."

But "the principles of Bitcoin are still true," she said. "Nothing about Bitcoin has changed."
