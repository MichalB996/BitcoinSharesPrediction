An unknown mining pool mysteriously seized the vast majority of hash power in the Bitcoin SV network, creating enormous fear and curiosity.

Bitcoin SV is in Danger!

Led by Craig Wright, who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin SV is seen as the “real Bitcoin” for a large audience. Such an enigmatic and risky incident in the network of crypto money, which is seen as real Bitcoin, reveals how deplorable the situation is.

Nothing is known about this mining pool that logs into the Bitcoin SV network. According to Coindance analysis firm, the total hash power in the Bitcoin SV network was at 675 PH / s 9 days ago. However, in the last 24 hours, this rate has increased to 1535 PH / s and has seen above two times.

Unknown miners or miners appear to have higher hash rates than the entire Bitcoin SV community. This again proves that the same people can do hard fork in the network as they wish and take the network completely.

Bitcoin SV did not react in this way to any news, and it was surprising that BSV was counting where it was expected while the decline was expected.
