Bullish Bias: Break of Falling Trendline on BTC to GBP

On the 4-hour time frame, it can be seen that BTC to GBP recently broke resistance at the falling trend line. The cryptocurrency rose to 5,994.66 and traded past the falling trend line which becomes apparent when you connect the highs of March 7 and March 12. This suggests that there could be enough buyers in the market to push bitcoin price higher against the British pound. Under this assumption, the recent downtick on BTC to GBP is nothing more than just a pullback. By drawing the Fibonacci retracement tool from the low of March 16 to the high of March 20, we can see that the cryptocurrency is already testing the Fib levels. Reversal candles between 4,592.50 to 5,108.60 could mean that BTC to GBP may soon rally to its March 20 high at 5,994.66.
