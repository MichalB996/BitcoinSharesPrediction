Bitcoin Turns Green

After a successful break above the $6,800 resistance, bitcoin price gained bullish momentum against the US Dollar. BTC extended its rise above the $7,000 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average.

It even surpassed the $7,200 resistance and traded as high as $7,302 before starting a downside correction. The bears were able to push the price below the $7,100 level, but the bulls were able to protect the $7,050 region.

Bitcoin formed a low at $7,066 and remained stable above the 100 hourly simple moving average. It seems like there is a strong support base forming near the $7,050 level. Moreover, there is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $7,100 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

The price is currently rising and trading near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $7,302 high to $7,066 low. An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $7,215 and $7,220 levels.

The first key hurdle is near the $7,250 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $7,302 high to $7,066 low. A successful break above the $7,250 level could open the doors for more upsides towards the $7,300 and $7,400 levels. The next major resistance is near the $7,500 level.

Key Breakdown Zone

On the downside, there is a major support near the $7,050 level and the 100 hourly SMA. If bitcoin fails to stay above the $7,050 and $7,000 support levels, it could start a fresh decline.

A successful close below the $7,000 support level might lead the price towards the $6,800 support area in the near term.
