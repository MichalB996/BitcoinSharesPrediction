Bitcoin is still hovering around the long-term area of interest around $7,000 to $8,000 as sellers are trying to defend the ceiling once more. If it holds, price could slide back to the next downside targets.

The Fibonacci extension tool shows where potential support levels are. The 38.2% level is around the $5,000 major psychological support while the 50% extension is closer to the swing low. Stronger selling pressure could drag bitcoin lower to the 61.8% level at $3,398 or the 78.6% level at $2,291.

The 100 SMA is still below the 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside or that the ceiling is more likely to hold than to break. These moving averages are also in line with the area of interest to add to its strength as resistance.

Volume has been subdued to indicate that a correction from the main trend is taking place. Stochastic is still pointing up to suggest that there is a bit of bullish pressure left before sellers take over, but ADX is below 25 to signal market consolidation.

The case for bitcoin appears to be getting stronger as traditional markets have been more volatile and sensitive to news updates lately. Apart from that, the looming bitcoin halving could also keep demand sustained as bulls would like to position ahead of a potential doubling of value as mining rewards are cut in half.

For now, though, it seems that bitcoin is trailing stocks and commodities as it takes advantage of risk rallies. A return in risk aversion could weigh on the cryptocurrency, but its losses might still be limited as the dollar could also be on weaker footing.

It appears that government stimulus efforts are propping risk assets these days, but the odds of a recession are pretty high and could keep a lid on these rallies.
