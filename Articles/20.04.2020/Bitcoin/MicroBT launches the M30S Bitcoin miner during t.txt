Next, WhatsMiner released the new standard of the 3X era: low power ratio, high stability and one-year warranty service. New standards have become an inevitable demand in the face of halving and the extension of the life cycle of mining rigs. The one-year warranty period, which first came out in the industry, not only implements the concept of customer first with practical actions, but also marks the confidence of WhatsMiner in its own products.

During the M30 launch event, Chen showed WhatsMiner's great achievements over the last three years: In 2017, WhatsMiner launched the first generation of M1/M3 product which achieved sales of 90,000 units that year, accounting for 7.2% of the total Bitcoin hashrate network.
