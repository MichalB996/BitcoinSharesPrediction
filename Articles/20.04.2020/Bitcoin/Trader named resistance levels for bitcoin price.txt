Training dealer and ForkLog Hub resident Pavel Gromov talks concerning the present market scenario.

Bitcoin for the fourth day held above $ 7000. Three makes an attempt to achieve a foothold above $ 7200 didn't result in success. The primary cryptocurrency stays in a slim vary of $ 7050- $ 7250. On the time of writing, the market capitalization was $ 208 billion, and the dominance index was 63.4%.

What's in conventional markets?

In conventional markets, we see a decline in oil and Asian indices. Then again, the S&P 500 confirmed progress final week and closed at 2874 with out the same old profit-taking on the finish of the week, which signifies the arrogance of market contributors in additional progress.

S&P 500 progress is opposite to financial adverse financial efficiency and firm studies. The primary cause for the expansion is the entry into the inventory market of latest funds poured into the economic system by the Fed's beneficiant hand.

What's within the cryptocurrency market?

It’s not obligatory to talk clearly about progress now. There are elements each in favor of the bulls and in favor of the bears.

In favor of progress is the truth that the price is held above $ 7000 for greater than 4 days - all of the straits are redeemed. Even the standard strait didn't happen on the weekend. I additionally take into account constructive the expansion within the quantity of USDT, which has been noticed for a number of weeks.

The anticipated continued progress of the S&P 500 additionally speaks in favor of a hike within the price of bitcoin to $ 7300- $ 7400.

In favor of the decline is the weak spot of patrons who haven't managed to achieve a foothold above $ 7200 3 times.

I feel that the more than likely choice for bitcoin is to proceed transferring within the $ 6500- $ 7300 channel.

An alternate is breakdown and consolidation above $ 7500. That is attainable on the exterior constructive (the expansion of the S&P 500, the curtailment of quarantine measures).

What do the graphs say?

On the day by day timeframe, after a extreme collapse of March 13, bitcoin exhibits a assured restoration.

To proceed the expansion, patrons have to preserve the vary of $ 6861- $ 6974.

BTC has two foremost medium-term resistance zones above: $ 7,700 and $ 8,200- $ 8,400.

The closest resistance is the vary of $ 7150- $ 7250.

This vary prior to now was the center of the commerce, from which all progress started to $ 10,500.

The higher restrict of this commerce is the extent of $ 7,700, which is the medium-term goal for patrons.

If we take into account the scenario with BTC for April, we are able to distinguish a wider channel of buying and selling: $ 6580- $ 7400.

If patrons fail to interrupt by means of the higher border of this commerce ($ 7400), holding above $ 6861, then the price could once more return to the decrease border ($ 6580) of this aspect.
