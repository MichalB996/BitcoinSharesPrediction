Bitcoin Price Support and Resistance

Bitcoin price is 0.31% higher at $7,148 as the number one cryptocurrency hovers above the 50-day moving average for the fourth consecutive trading session. The technical picture improves above the 7,000 mark, and a test of the 100-day moving average can’t be ruled out.

On the upside, the first hurdle stands at $7,220 the daily top. The second significant resistance will be met at $7,256 the high from Sunday’s trading session. In case of a bullish breakout, bitcoin might test the high from April 9, at 7,359.

On the contrary, initial support for Bitcoin price stands at $7,090 the daily low. If BTCUSD breaks below that level, the next support stands will be met at $6,885 the 50-day moving average. Below 6,885, the next support zone stands at 6,463 the low from April 16.
