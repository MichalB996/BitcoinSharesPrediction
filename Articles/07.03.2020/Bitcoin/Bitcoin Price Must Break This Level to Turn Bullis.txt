Bitcoin Bitcoin Price Must Break This Level to Turn Bullish Again

After breaking above $9,000 and finding support, Bitcoin price is seeking direction again. But the leading asset must cross over the $9,500 resistance to initiate another bull rally, analysts state.

Bitcoin Price Bounces Off $8,550, Faces Resistance Above $9,000

Bitcoin price managed to bounce off the recent lows in the $8,500 range. But standing above $9,100 support is not enough to set a bullish direction. A more rapid price move, as BTC gets closer to the block reward halving, will depend on a trek above $9,500.

In March, crypto analysis reveals $9,500 is the key to regaining five-digit prices. After a weekend of little activity, bitcoin trading volume has taken a backward step to $37 billion in the past 24 hours.

Josh Rager believes long positions can only be taken temporarily, with more setbacks possible unless BTC breaks decisively above $9,500. In historical terms, BTC has shown a strong resistance at $9,500.

$BTC Any long trade is a short term trade until Bitcoin can break and hold above the $9500s $9400s to $9500s has played a important S/R level since June 2019 â€“ breaking above this level will be key for bullish continuation My take profit targets start near $9400 pic.twitter.com/zjjXoaBrQA â€” Josh Rager ðŸ“ˆ (@Josh_Rager) March 7, 2020

Moving to a new yearly high may pass through stunted trading, as BTC is yet to regain several resistance levels.

CryptoCred also concedes that a move above $9,500 would invalidate the bearish case. Even under $9,200, bitcoin price is retesting the monthly resistance, though trades based on bullish expectations depend on the dayâ€™s closing level.

$BTC Retesting monthly resistance after a weak monthly close. We're close to bearish invalidation ($9500s reclaim) therefore a good area to do business. My preferred entry would be a deep spike through yesterday's high (early sellers' stops) which closes at/below grey box. pic.twitter.com/TMVBwPfwdi â€” Cred (@CryptoCred) March 6, 2020

The Worst Bearish Scenarios So Far Avoided Drop to $5,000

So far, bitcoin price has defied the more bearish predictions for steep drops to as low as $5,000. Most trades are concentrated in regaining support levels above $8,000. In the past month, BTC has become even less volatile. The volatility index shrank to 2.85% after briefly spiking above 4% in January. In the past weeks, bitcoin has often stayed within the range of a few hundred dollars, though still showing the capability of moving by $1,000 in a day.

The trek to $9,500 may be varied, with some contentious points of support and resistance. For now, BTC stopped below $9,200, with several smaller key levels to regain.

Despite high price action, BTC has not repeated previous periods of almost continuous growth, and is still range-bound. For now, bitcoin price stays within a long-term bullish framework, but future markets have to work out complicated moves around certain price levels.

BTC market cap dominance has also fallen toward 63.2%, mostly due to the hike of some of the larger altcoins. But without a larger BTC price move, an altcoin season is not yet announced, instead remaining limited to separate altcoin pumps.
