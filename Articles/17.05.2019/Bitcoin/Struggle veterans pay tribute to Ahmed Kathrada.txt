Ahmed Kathrada would’ve worked to restore the country to its former glory, these were the words of struggle veteran, Sophie De Bruyn, at the unveiling of the Kathrada’s life-size statue at the Cradle of Humankind in Maropeng.

Kathrada was honoured by the national heritage council.

Asked if uncle Kathy, as he is affectionately known, would be happy about the state of the country and the African National Congress (ANC), a hero of the struggle de Bruyn says he would’ve expected more.

“Kathy was distressed about the former nine years, the bad record brought the ANC into disrepute, he would assist into bringing the country to its former glory.”

Minister of Tourism and the chairperson of the Ahmed Kathrada foundation, Derek Hanekom, pleads with the nation to never forget those who fought for our hard earned freedom.

The unveiling of Kathrada’s statue is a bid to immortalise his massive contribution to the country’s liberation movement.

The human-size statue is an addition to many tributes given to other heroes like him.
