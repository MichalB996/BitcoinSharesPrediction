2019 proved to be a roller-coaster year for the Bitcoin and altcoin markets.

Bitcoin started the year at lows of around $3,150 before threatening to break its all-time high in the summer, surging all the way up to $14,000.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is recording higher lows and is trading well above $8,100. As is usually the case, for altcoins to reach new all-time highs, Bitcoin needs to pump first.

However, in this article, I’ll take a look at the top four altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin over the last year.

Before I dive a bit deeper into each altcoin individually, let me take a moment to compare the top-performing altcoins vs Bitcoin over the last 12 months.

At the time of writing, Chainlink (LINK) is ranked as number one with close to 100% gains since last year, while Bitcoin SV has been experiencing some impressive momentum recently.

Next up is Egretia (EGT) with gains topping 90%, followed closely by Ripio Credit Network (RCN) and Tezos (XTZ) with gains of 76% and 30% respectively.

Finally, we have Bitcoin SV (BSV) with gains of 15% and Binance Coin (BNB) with gains of 10%.

For the time being, I’ll ignore Egretia due to low volume.

So let’s take a closer look at the biggest winners over the last year: Chainlink, Ripio, Tezos, and Bitcoin SV.

Fundamentally, the Chainlink network provides reliable tamper-proof inputs and outputs for complex smart contracts on any blockchain.

LINK is currently trading above 26,200 sats. At the moment, it’s looking quite grim for Chainlink as the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA are close to crossing to the downside.

Despite this latest downtrend, LINK is still up over 90% against Bitcoin since last year. At its peak, Chainlink was up over 330% versus Bitcoin.

However, LINK wasn’t able to hold its gains and the volume profile shows the coin could be in dire straits. If LINK is unable to hold support near 24,000 sats, it could drop further down towards the next levels of support at 20,000 and 12,000 sats.

It’s important to underline however that Chainlink dumped over 50% between July and September last year before making its way to new all-time highs.

This means we could see LINK drop below 18,000 sats before pumping again towards a new high.

If buyers remain in control, I expect LINK to pump sometime during Q1 2020. The altcoin historically reaches new all-time highs every 115 to 130 days, so we could see a new high during February or March 2020.

On the other hand, if price drops down further below 12,000 sats and is incapable of pushing towards the 200-day EMA, I would switch my position and avoid LINK.
