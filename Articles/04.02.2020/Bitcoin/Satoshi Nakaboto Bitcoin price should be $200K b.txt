Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin every fucking day.

Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Stephen Hawking used to say: Shleppppppp it!

Bitcoin price

We closed the day, February 03 2020, at a price of $9,293. That’s a minor 0.54 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$51.15. It was the lowest closing price in six days.

We’re still 53 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).

Bitcoin market cap

Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $169,126,861,034. It now commands 66 percent of the total crypto market.

Bitcoin volume

Yesterday’s volume of $30,934,096,509 was the highest in three days, 75 percent above last year’s average, and 31 percent below last year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 614 tons of gold.

Bitcoin transactions

A total of 330,864 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 1 percent above last year’s average and 26 percent below last year’s high.

Bitcoin transaction fee

Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.21. That’s $3.50 below last year’s high of $3.71.

Bitcoin distribution by address

As of now, there are 13,354 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 6.1 percent of the total supply, the top 100 15.1 percent, and the top 1000 34.9 percent.

Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin

With a market capitalization of $170 Billion, Oracle has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.

Bitcoin’s path towards $1 million

On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.

He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 95.3 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $201,227 by now, according to dickline.info.

Bitcoin on Twitter

Yesterday 32,917 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 80.7 percent above last year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day last year about Bitcoin was 75,543.
