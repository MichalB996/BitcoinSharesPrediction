Bitcoin (BTC) found itself caught in the throes of intense volatility over the past several hours, with its recent bout of sideways trading within the mid-$10,300 region resulting in a major overnight drop down towards $10,000.

Bulls were able to push Bitcoin slightly higher after this drop occurred, with buyers ardently attempting to defend the key psychological price level of $10,000.

It now appears, however, that the crypto is quickly approaching a critical technical support level that has been formed throughout the course of the crypto‚Äôs recent uptrend, with a break below this level opening the gates for significantly further downside.

Bitcoin Plummets Towards $10,000 During Sharp Overnight Movement

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading down just under 1% at its current price of $10,240, which marks a notable decline from daily highs of over $10,400 that were set during yesterday‚Äôs slow upwards grind.

This drop first occurred overnight during a sharp movement that led the crypto to as low as $10,100, which is where bulls stepped in and helped guide BTC back up to $10,300.

From this point, Bitcoin has been able to show some signs that it is stabilizing around its current price levels, and analysts are noting that this price action is a ‚Äúliquidation game,‚Äù making it incredibly dangerous to trade BTC at this time.

Josh Rager, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, spoke about this in a recent tweet, noting that altcoins could continue their upwards momentum as BTC trades sideways.

‚ÄúHaving fun yet? Looks like BTC has been a liquidation game, catching those offsides with high leverage. 4% move down, 4% move up followed by another 4% back down. No Bitcoin trade zone, but keeping eyes on alts that could potentially move w/ BTC sideways,‚Äù he explained.

BTC Is About to Test a Critical Support Level

One byproduct of this movement is the fact that this latest drop has led BTC towards the lower boundary of a multi-week rising wedge that the crypto has formed over the past couple of weeks.

Teddy, another popular crypto analyst on Twitter, spoke about this rising wedge in a recent tweet, while referencing the chart seen below.

‚ÄúBTC Daily attempted to break resistance of rising wedge, but was rejected. Looks like we are going for a third lucky retest of support ‚Äì bulls don‚Äôt let me down,‚Äù he noted.
