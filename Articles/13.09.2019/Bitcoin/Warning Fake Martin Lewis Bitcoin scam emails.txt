Fraudulent ads using Martin's name or image to advertise products and schemes, such as Bitcoin, are unfortunately nothing new. Facebook even agreed to launch a scam ad reporting tool on its site and app to combat fake ads, as a result of a campaigning defamation lawsuit by Martin.

But we've seen increased reports of scam emails using Martin's name and image to push Bitcoin schemes over the past few months. In one 24-hour period in August, we had 28 people tell us they'd received the emails.

As we've seen so many reports in such a short space of time, we wanted to warn against these emails and make it clear they are nothing to do with Martin or MSE.

See the Fake Martin Lewis ads guide for more on what to watch out for.

What do the fake emails look like?

The scam emails tend to use a picture of Martin along with a claim that he "lends a hand to British families" with a Bitcoin scheme, promising profits of Â£450 per day, as seen below.
