In morning, we discussed the chances of more losses and sell opportunities for bitcoin below $9,000 against the US Dollar. BTC remained in a bearish zone and it failed to break the $8,850 resistance area.

Additionally, the price is now trading well below the $8,800 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It seems like the price failed to capitalize above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $9,150 high to $8,610 low.

More importantly, the price was rejected near the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $9,150 high to $8,610 low. Bitcoin is now trading below the $8,750 level and is following a bearish path.

Recently, there was a break below a contracting triangle with support near $8,730 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Therefore, there is a risk of more downsides below the $8,650 and $8,600 levels.

In the mentioned bearish case, there is a risk of a sharp breakdown even below the $8,500 support. On the upside, an initial resistance for the bulls is near the $8,820 level and the 100 hourly SMA.
