Stefan Rust has replaced Roger Ver as CEO of Bitcoin.com.

Longtime CEO and Bitcoin Cash leader Ver is now the Executive Chairman of Bitcoin.com, according to a release. Ver was CEO since 2016.

Rust joined Bitcoin.com six months prior to his appointment as Global Head of Corporate and Business Development. Before joining the website, Rust founded Exicon, a marketing automation platform.

Ver and Rust intend to co-lead Bitcoin.com. Typically, executive chairmen operate in an oversight role for financials and company direction. Information on the former CEO’s new role in the company has not been disclosed, however.

“I’m hugely excited to take on the role of CEO working alongside Roger. Together we can now turbocharge the awesome team and great brand that is Bitcoin.com,” Rust said. “It’s going to be a wild ride, so don’t miss it!”

A United Kingdom court struck down a recent libel suit against Roger Ver by Bitcoin SV proponent Craig Wright. Wright alleged Ver libelled him in a mid-April video saying he was not pseudo-anonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. The judge found little evidence to corroborate Wright’s claim of reputational damages.

Ver did not respond to a request for comment by press time.
