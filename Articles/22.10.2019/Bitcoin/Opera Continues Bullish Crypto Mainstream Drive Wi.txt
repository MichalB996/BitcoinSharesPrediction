Browser minnow Opera is ramping up cryptocurrency support for Android users in version 54, which has just been released on Tuesday. Among a host of other cosmetic improvements and a new UI, this latest release improves upon the current crypto wallet with support for both Bitcoin and Tron payments.

Ethereum has been the staple payment option of the low-flying web browser for more than a year now; however, developers have heeded the calls in recent months for integration with other major cryptocurrencies.

Opera Looks to Undercut the Big Boys With Crypto

Opera is a Chromium-based browser that leverages off the innovations made by Google in the browser development space.

Despite introducing its own set of interesting new tools, it – like most other browsers – is struggling to keep up with the overarching dominance of Chrome:

Opera Software AS, who develops the browser, is attempting to differentiate itself from the pack. Its solution currently includes novel features like free unlimited VPN, a built-in ad blocker, and, of course, a crypto wallet.

Apple and Google, by comparison, have yet to integrate any meaningful crypto solutions into their mainstream browsers. With vastly more browser market share, they may be resting too precariously on their own laurels.
