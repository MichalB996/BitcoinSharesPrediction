Bitcoin ended its gaining streak beginning on Thursday and continued with the drop further on Friday. It was initially forming a rising wedge, a Bearish pattern, and it soon started dropping after falling out of the wedge.

The day’s range for the BTCUSD has been $6,822.91 — $7,314.93.

Chart by TradingView

Bitcoin has already dropped by almost 6% today. Many investors had jumped into the fake Bull trap earlier in the week when BTCUSD had started rising with the US Equity markets.

Bitcoin likely to drop further

Although Bitcoin has dropped almost 10% in the last two days, it might not have bottomed out yet.

Falling Bitcoin prices amounts to Bitcoin miners being less profitable, which translates to miners moving out of the network. The halving of rewards is likely to take place in a month, and with that, more Bitcoin miners will move out, leading to lesser security in the network. A compromised system would likely be prone to attackers.

The daily chart, as well as the four-hour chart, indicate that the traded volume has been very low. This is another Bearish signal.

Here’s what the Technical indicators of Bitcoin point to:

Key resistances are at $6,904.97, $7175.96, $7,413.00.

Support lies at $6,645.45, $6,094.45 and $5,997.41.

The Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic indicator point to a ‘ neutral ‘ signal, whereas the MACD gives a ‘ sell ‘ signal for the Bitcoin.

If the Bitcoin drops even further and the RSI enters the oversold territory, a potential ‘long’ trade could exist in that region. However, it all depends on Bitcoin’s movement from hereon.
