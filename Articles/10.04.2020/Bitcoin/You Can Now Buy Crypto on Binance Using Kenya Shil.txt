Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trade volume globally, has added Kenya Shillings (KES) as the latest set of fiat currencies that enable users to purchase bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on the Binance main exchange.

Binance users can now use their native fiat currencies to Buy Crypto with Visa credit & debit card.

Cryptocurrencies available for purchase at launch are:

BTC

ETH

BNB

XRP

BUSD

USDT

To use this service go to Buy Crypto and select “Pay with Bank Card.”

Currently, the minimum amount of transaction using Kenya Shillings is KES 1, 600 for any of the above crypto assets.

Binance users in Kenya will now be able to change currency denominations in KES and see live trades in their local currency moving forward.

The new development means that Kenyans can now either directly buy crypto on Binance or buy via Paxful. The recent partnership between the two companies enabled Paxful to become a Binance fiat gateway for Binance users. On the other hand, this gives direct access to digital asset trading on Binance to Paxful users.

UPDATE: Visa & Mastercard payments in the “Pay with Bank Card” feature have been temporarily disabled for African countries including Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa.

We shall update you as soon as this feature is once again available.
