Bitcoins are a decentralized form of cryptocurrency. This means that a financial institution or government does not regulate them. Therefore, unlike a traditional bank account, a long list of documents, such as IDs, is not required to create a so-called Bitcoin wallet. With a bitcoin wallet, you can access your bitcoins and send bitcoins to others.

How to Create an Account

You can buy a bitcoin wallet from a bitcoin broker such as Coinbase. When you open a wallet through a certified broker, you get a bitcoin address consisting of a series of numbers and letters, similar to a bank account number and a secret key, which also includes a number of numbers and letters of the password.

How Bitcoin Works As An Anonymous Payment Processor

You can do 3 things with bitcoins, shop, anonymously send money to someone, or use it as an investment. More and more retailers are accepting bitcoins as a form of payment. If you use Bitcoin instead of cash, you make this purchase anonymously. The same applies to send money since there is no need to spend a lot of payments for anonymous Bitcoin settings. In practice, you can send money anonymously to another person.

How Bitcoin Works as an Investment

Bitcoin’s price changes from time to time. For comparison: at the beginning of 2013, the average price of Bitcoin was about 400 US dollars, and at the end of 2013, the price of bitcoin optimizer to more than 1000 US dollars. Therefore, if I launched two bitcoins worth $ 800 and saved them as an investment at the end of 2013, these two bitcoins would cost more than $ 2,000 instead of $ 800. Many people save bitcoins because of their value fluctuate.

Bitcoin Casinos and Poker Sites

Due to the anonymity of Bitcoin, the gaming industry has used Bitcoin as a form of payment. Bitcoin casinos and bitcoin poker sites come to life and offer their players the opportunity to make deposits, play bitcoins at tables, and withdraw money directly to their Bitcoin wallet. This means that there are no taxes or options for state control. Like in a regular Nevada casino, where you don’t need to register anywhere and all transactions are anonymous.

How do you send Bitcoins?

To pay for goods and services or send bitcoins, a person needs 3 things: your bitcoin address, your private key, and the person’s bitcoin address. From now on, enter 3 information about your Bitcoin wallet: entry, exit. The entry refers to your address, the rest refers to the number of bitcoins you sent, and the output refers to the address of the recipient.
