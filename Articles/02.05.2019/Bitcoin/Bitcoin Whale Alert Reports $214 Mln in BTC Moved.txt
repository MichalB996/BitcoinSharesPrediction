On May 1, Whale Alert reported on his Twitter account that 40 thousand Bitcoins, which is over $213 mln, were moved between two unknown wallets.

ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ 40,000 #BTC (214,310,470 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet

The Bitcoins were transferred from the wallet bc1q9sh6544xls87x7skjzyfhkty4wq7z76vn7qzq9 to the bc1q5shngj24323nsrmxv99st02na6srekfctt30ch address. Tx: https://t.co/OovyE7b2mj â€” Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 1, 2019

The first address occupies position #22 on the Bitcoin richest wallets list.

The BTC held since early 2018

Data shows that the sender had been storing the 40,000 BTC since early 2018 â€“ the period right after Bitcoin price reached its ATH and then started rolling downhill.

On May 1, the sender went down from position #21 of the richest BTC wallets to #22. Presently, the address contains zero Bitcoin after sending the 40,000 BTC to the above-mentioned address.

As the list gets updated later on, the receiving wallet will hold position #22.
