We’ve all witnessed the massive uprising of Bitcoin. What started as a concept in which nobody believed, turned into one of the best investments that a person can make. Throughout the years, we have seen many people and corporations put their money to be a part of this revolution. Celebrity entrepreneurs such as Richard Branson are advocates of the Bitcoin revolution, having invested early in the cryptocurrency.

During the early stages of the Bitcoin revolution, its value was nothing. That was in the period between 2008-2009. After the transactions with the cryptocurrencies grew in the next few years, Bitcoin had risen, and its value was $266 in 2013. From 2013-2016, Bitcoin had some ups and downs, but the real boom happened in 2017. The price of one Bitcoin started growing massively, and it reached an all-time high in December 2017, when it was valued at shocking 19,000.

After that, the market started stabilizing, and as of today, Bitcoin’s value is somewhere around $9,000. It was interesting to watch the whole revolution take place because many people made a fortune after just investing a couple of dollars. The revolution didn’t miss the eye of some well-known entrepreneurs. These people are now known as some of the most famous Bitcoin entrepreneurs. Why don’t we take a look at the top 5 list?
