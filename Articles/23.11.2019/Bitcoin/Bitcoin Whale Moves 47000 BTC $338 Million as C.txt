Bitcoin Bitcoin Whale Moves 47,000 BTC ($338 Million) as China Cracks Down on Crypto

Chinaâ€™s recent crackdown on cryptocurrencies may have caused Bitcoin whales to move huge quantities of BTC.

Chinaâ€™s recent praises of blockchain technology do not seem to extend to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, as the countryâ€™s central bank launched another crackdown on crypto.

The Peopleâ€™s Bank of China warned that â€˜illegal actionsâ€™ involving digital assets would not be tolerated, and noted that investors should not mistake crypto with blockchain. Only hours after the move, a Bitcoin whale made their move in a single, massive transaction.

Bitcoin Whale Moves Over $300 Million in BTC

As mentioned, a single, massive transaction was recorded only a few hours ago, involving 47,000 BTC, which is over $337.8 million considering current prices. The transaction recorded that funds were moved from one unknown wallet to another.

ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ 46,000 #BTC (337,889,361 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet Tx: https://t.co/iwKf26Sz4C â€” Whale Alert (@whale_alert) November 22, 2019

The news from China also resulted in a massive Bitcoin price drop, in the last few days. BTC is currently sitting at 00 after dropping by 4.33% in the last 24 hours.

The dump brought down altcoins, as well. The top 10 cryptos are currently seeing drops between 4% and 8.7%, excluding the stablecoin Tether (USDT), which climbed to the 4th spot on the list of largest cryptocurrencies.

China Steps Up Efforts to Launch its Own Coin

Chinaâ€™s move, which seems to have started this series of events, comes in light of recent discussions regarding the countryâ€™s potential to open up to crypto. It appears that the interest in digital currencies in China rose due to the countryâ€™s positive stance towards blockchain technology. Many started speculating whether China might lift the ban on cryptocurrency trading.

Now, the country once again confirmed its anti-crypto stance, although it still continues with plans to launch its own, national digital currency known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP). The central bank confirmed that Chinaâ€™s national coin is still under tests and detailed studies, but that it will see launch eventually.
