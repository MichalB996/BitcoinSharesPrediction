Bitcoin price tumble to two month lows as the sell-off in risky assets accelerate today amid the increasing coronavirus outbreak worries. Today the sell-off has been across the board and even gold is feeling the pressure. Bitcoin is also a victim of the sell-off as more and more investors are holding positions in cryptocurrencies as the 11 years bull market and excess liquidity has shift some mainstream investors to alternative assets such as digital assets.

That kind of investors mainly invest according to sentiment, when there is a bullish sentiment they buy aggressively any assets while when the momentum turns negative they proceed with mass liquidations of their portfolio.

On other reason for the sell-off in cryptocurrencies might be some forced liquidations amid margins calls in equities. Bitcoin is still positive in 2020, and investors liquidate profitable positions.
