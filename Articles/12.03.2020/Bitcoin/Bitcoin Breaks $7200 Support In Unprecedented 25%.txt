This price fall is largely driven by Coronavirus fears after President Trump announced that he would be closing borders for any European tourists for at least 30 days. This sent shockwaves of fear throughout the entire economy as both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average plummetted to fresh lows not seen in over a year.

This latest Bitcoin price drop has now wiped out any of the positive gains seen in 2020
