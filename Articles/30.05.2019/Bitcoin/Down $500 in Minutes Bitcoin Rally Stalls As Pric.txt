TITLE: Down $500 in Minutes: Bitcoin Rally Stalls As Price Rejected Above $9K
URL:   https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-price-fades-rally-above-9000

Bitcoin’s price peaked above $9,000 for the first time in over a year earlier today, but the rally was short lived as its price returned below $8,600 just minutes later.

At 16:00 UTC, the world’s largest cryptocurrency jumped 4.6 percent from today’s UTC opening price of $8,681 and climbed as high as $9,084 – its highest price since May 10, 2018, according to CoinDesk pricing data.

However, sellers quickly halted the rally, causing the price of bitcoin to drop more than $500 to $8,548 in just 30 minutes after reaching today’s high.

In all, Messari data reveals $26.3 billion in reported bitcoin volume has traded hands so far today.

The broader cryptocurrency market also felt the pull of gravity shortly after climbing to a 10-month high of $285.8 billion in total capitalization.

Highly ranked cryptocurrencies such as tron (TRX), litecoin (LTC), and EOS (EOS) are all reporting losses greater than 3 percent after initially being a few percent in the green before the market wide dip.

That said, some cryptocurrencies are still reporting 24-hour growth. The prices for dogecoin (DOGE) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) – both top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap – are still up more than 5 percent on the day.

What’s more, today’s pullback has hardly put a dent in an impressive performance from crypto bulls this month, with bitcoin still reporting month-to-date gains of roughly 63 percent at the time of writing.
