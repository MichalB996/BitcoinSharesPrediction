For many crypto holders, Bitcoin Cash is much more appealing than Bitcoin ‚Äì it offers a higher processing speed and lower fees. Like its parent coin, Bitcoin Cash went through a boost in 2017: being launched for the price of $250, it hit the $651 mark within one day and managed to reach $900. After that, a serious crypto market nosedive followed, and BCH was struck by this wave, too.

Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash ‚Äì main differences

The storm seems to be quieter now, and the crypto world is very optimistic about Bitcoin Cash price predictions.

What do experts think?

The crypto market is ever-volatile, and the BCH price can change in minutes, so making short-term predictions is quite hard. However, experts looking at the future of Bitcoin Cash readily make predictions concerning how it will perform in 2019. Let‚Äôs check out their opinions.

Roger Ver, one of Bitcoin's main supporters, is sure that BCH can gain considerable value within two years. He is convinced that Bitcoin Cash can be stored and used just like cash, so it‚Äôs perfect for everyday purchases. According to the Trading Beasts website, 2019 will be a lucky year for BCH because its price could go up to $2,703.17. In 2020, it will continue growing to reach as much as $5,635.44 and be as low as $3,832.10. The Smartereum crypto prediction platform states that Bitcoin Cash will reach as high as $6,700, which means x55 growth within a year. Their five-year BCH prediction is mind-blowing: $24,600 seems to be a fantastic sum. CryptoGround provides a more realistic price prediction: BCH might reach $707 by the end of this year and crawl to the level of $3,067 within five years. The Us Lifted crypto prediction website gives a very generous BCH prediction: $9,735 by the end of 2019. Considering the current price of $123, this is too bullish and optimistic.

Users from various forums speculate that Bitcoin Cash can reach $9,560.28 within two years, which doesn‚Äôt seem to be realistic at this very moment.

What can drive BCH growth?

However, we cannot ignore BCH‚Äôs salient features. First, this cryptocurrency is more technologically advanced than Bitcoin. Secondly, BCH is being actively developed. There are several teams working on BCH: they represent many projects, including Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitprim, Nchain, Bitcrust, ElectrumX, Parity and Bitcoin XT.

Recently, Bitcoin Cash got listed on the Gemini Exchange, which will contribute to its growth. Besides, a few months ago, Bitcoin Cash counted over 2.1 mln transactions, which accounted for 63% of total cryptocurrency transactions made within that 24-hour span. This was a very successful achievement of the BCH community, and they hope to repeat this scenario.

Thus, we can conclude that Bitcoin Cash has great chances to reach the $1,000 threshold this year, and crawl to $2,000 or higher by the end of 2019.
