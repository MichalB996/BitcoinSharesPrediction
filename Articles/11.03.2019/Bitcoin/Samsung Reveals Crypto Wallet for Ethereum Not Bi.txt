After a round of rumors and speculation, Samsung has reportedly revealed a full-blown crypto wallet for the Galaxy S10.

Samsung says the wallet will support Ethereum and Ethereum-based tokens, but will not support Bitcoin on day one, according to a report from CoinDesk Korea. Additional cryptocurrencies will be added in the future. The wallet also includes support for decentralized apps at launch, including Enjin, Cosmee, CryptoKitties and CoinDuck.

Ripple, Zilliqa, NEM

The advantages of public ledgers such as XRP, Zilliqa and NEM will be at the forefront at Money 20/20 Asia, a networking event for the world’s leaders in payments, financial services and fintech.

Ripple’s senior vice president of product Asheesh Birla, NEM Foundation co-founder Jeff McDonald and Zilliqa co-founder Max Kantelia will join a panel called “Does the world really need high throughput private and public blockchains?”

According to the website, participants from the banking sector will be in attendance along with high-tech heavyweights such as Google, Facebook, IBM, Amazon Web Services, Ant Financial, Apple and PayPal. The event runs from March 19th through the 21st in Singapore.

EOS

A crazy crypto transaction on the EOS network turned out to be fake. Whale watchers freaked out when a user appeared to initiate a transaction of 1 trillion EOS worth about $3.6 trillion.

🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 1,000,000,000,000 #EOS (3,661,729,952,714 USD) transferred from Unknown wallet to Unknown wallet Tx: https://t.co/goI2zFyasp — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) March 11, 2019

The transaction, which was about eight times bigger than the entire crypto market cap, was quickly determined to be illegitimate and was removed from the network.

An EOS user named "fuckhacker.x" figured out how to create a large fake transaction, but it seems EOS was able to detect it. Unfortunately, the transaction was broadcasted before it was removed. We have built in an extra check to prevent it from happening again. — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) March 11, 2019
