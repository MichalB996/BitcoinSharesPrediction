Bitcoin Cash House African Expansion to Feature in Toronto Meetup

Besides networking with the local community, bitcoin cash meetups are a great way to learn about the development of the cryptocurrency and the ecosystem from the people that make it happen. The upcoming Toronto meetup, for example, will feature new details about the expansion of the Bitcoin Cash House to Africa.

Toronto to Host Special Bitcoin Cash Meetup on Sunday

A local group of bitcoin cash supporters from the most populous city in Canada, Toronto, is going to host a special meetup this upcoming Sunday, December 1. The event will take place at the Betty’s on King Dive Bar, starting at 4PM local time. The plan is for attendees to mingle, enjoy drinks and food and win some BCH swag, all while learning more about the cryptocurrency. You can sign up for the meetup here.

In attendance at the Toronto event will be Bitcoin.com’s Matt Aaron, host of the Humans of Bitcoin podcast. There will also be a special presentation about Bitcoin Cash House, the crypto education and adoption hub in Venezuela, and how the venture is expanding next to a number of African countries such as Ghana.

Matt Aaron commented about the upcoming bitcoin cash Toronto meetup: “Last week was the all-star meetup in London. Blockchain.com, Roger Ver, Nic Cary, Tobias Ruck. It was incredible. The Toronto meetup is going to be special in a different way. These are the community all stars. Chris Bridgman who leads the Bitcoin Cash meetup groups around the world, Hamza of the BCH charity Coins4clothes which also has a big announcement. And of course we’ll discuss Bitcoin Cash adoption in Venezuela and expansion into other countries. This meetup is about adoption for those who can most immediately benefit from Bitcoin Cash.”

Physical Crypto Education Hubs in the Community

The Bitcoin Cash House in Venezuela is an education hub in the city of Barquisimeto where local cryptocurrency advocates teach Venezuelans about the power of digital money. As we reported soon after its launch, some of the topics the Bitcoin Cash House will educate local people on include how to send money to friends and family anywhere in the world instantly, advantages of crypto over traditional money, how to store and spend crypto, how to protect assets against volatility with SLP tokens including the USDH stablecoin, and jobs in crypto as well as developer opportunities. The project is the brainchild of Roberto Garcia and is sponsored by Bitcoin.com and Sideshift.ai.

Another one of the details that will be discussed by Matt Aaron is that the new website for the Venezuela Bitcoin Cash House, available at Casabitcoin.cash, will be built by volunteers from the University of Massachusetts’ Bitcoin and Blockchain Club. About the announcement in Toronto he added: “I’m going to present a framework that we have developed. How to open source an education hub that turns into a profitable enterprise for the local owner and spurs adoption of Bitcoin Cash.”
