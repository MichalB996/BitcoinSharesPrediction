Bitcoin saw a 10% price decline over the past 24 hours of trading as it collapses beneath the $8,000 level. It rolled over a few days ago after climbing above $9,000 and went on to tumble amidst fears of a pricing war in oil between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The two OPEC members had been at a meeting on Friday in which they could not agree to a deal regarding the production levels of oil barrels. In retaliation, Saudi Arabia slashed the cost of oil barrels to their Chinese partners by as much as $7 and stated that they would ramp up their production to 2 million barrels per day.

This news caused Oil prices to plummet by over 30% and the global markets followed suit with the S&P 500 falling over 5% and the Dow Jones dropping by 1,200 points.
