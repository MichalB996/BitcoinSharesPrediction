It is never too late to start investing in Bitcoin. Investors continue going long and short with Bitcoin. Several governments are trying to stop the Bitcoin, and some are trying to understand it.

Anytime Bitcoin drops, investors are probably embarrassed, but it time and again happens that it comes back talk and strong like before. It always looks like Bitcoin has two main futures one is to the moon, and the other is dead. The market is still worried and wising the extremes. When there is volatility, and the Bitcoin is trending in the middle, they are not sure how to react. They feel doomed. They can never take Bitcoin in the normal sense.

Financial collapse is inevitable, and many of them are trying to hide their wealth in Gold and Bitcoin. Remember, Bitcoin was, first of all, created after the 2008 financial crisis.

Peter Schiff previously tweeted: “Bitcoin was created after the 2008 financial crisis, and hodlers always assumed that it would be the safe-haven of choice during the next. It looks like they assumed wrong. If Bitcoin is not a currency, not a store of value, and not a haven, then what is it, and why own it?”

Sydney Ifergan, the crypto expert, tweeted: “It is not good to ask about Bitcoin to someone who is not sure about the crypto world. Prospective investors do not want to work based on ifs and buts and assumptions.”

Some basic education about blockchain and how bitcoin works is important for investors to go about it.

Bitcoin Rivals

Bitcoin has developed more rivals than it had during the early days of its coming. Several widely known people came out against Bitcoin. The not to miss opponent is Warren Buffet. Buffet’s attitude towards Bitcoin needs to explanation. Buffet, in the past, stated: “In terms of value – zero. I don’t have any cryptocurrency, and I never will.”

Bitcoin Buys and Sells

Bitcoin buys and sells triggered by different events that contribute to the market sentiments. Most of the time, there are exaggerations about Bitcoin’s death. A soft fork is scheduled this year. The soft-fork is backward compatible, and therefore all nodes don’t need to upgrade. The upcoming upgrade is expected to improve on the privacy and scalability of Bitcoin.

Despite the coming of the many rivals, Bitcoin continues to be the king, and some investors are still prepared to invest in the coin trusting its viability and power.
