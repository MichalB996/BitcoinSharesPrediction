MAGI calculation

To calculate your modified adjusted gross income, take your AGI and add back certain deductions. Many of these deductions are rare, so it's possible your AGI and MAGI can be identical. According to the IRS, your MAGI is your AGI with the addition of the following deductions, if applicable:

Student loan interest

One-half of self-employment tax

Qualified tuition expenses

Tuition and fees deduction

Passive loss or passive income

IRA contributions

Taxable social security payments

The exclusion for income from U.S. savings bonds

Foreign earned income exclusion

Foreign housing exclusion or deduction

The exclusion under 137 for adoption expenses

Rental losses

Any overall loss from a publicly traded partnership

MAGI effects on your taxes

Your MAGI is used as a basis for determining whether you qualify for certain tax deductions. One of the most notable is in determining whether or not your contributions to an individual retirement plan are deductible.

For example, as of 2019, if you were a single filer and covered by a retirement plan at work, you couldn't take an IRA deduction if you had an MAGI of $74,000 or higher. You also couldn't take a deduction for student loan interest if you had a MAGI of $85,000 or higher as a single, or $170,000 if married and filing jointly.
