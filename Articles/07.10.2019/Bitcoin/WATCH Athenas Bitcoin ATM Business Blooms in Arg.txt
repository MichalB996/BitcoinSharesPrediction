In this edition of CoinDesk On Location reporter Diana Aguilar talks to Dante Galeazzi, country manager for Athena Bitcoin in Argentina. Athena is one of the first and biggest crypto ATM networks in the country. Athena has become a lifeline for many refugees and the ability to buy and sell bitcoin – and send it to other countries in Latin America – is picking up steam.

Galeazzi talks about the rise of the machines in Argentina and walks our reporter through the process and how the company localized the experience for the Argentine market.
