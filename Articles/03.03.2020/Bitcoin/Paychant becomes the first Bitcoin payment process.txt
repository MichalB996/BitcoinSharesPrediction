Paychant lets merchants accept cryptocurrency payment. Crypto payments that are received from customers are instantly converted to fiat money, giving merchants the option to receive payout directly to their bank account in local currency (NGN).

“Using our platform does not require any prior experience of cryptocurrency or blockchain technology, as the platform is designed in a way that merchants are familiar with. Merchants will set the price of their items in a local currency, and our system does the calculation in real-time to crypto equivalent for the customers who want to pay.” the founders explained.



Paychant provides a simple API for merchants who wants to integrate the payment gateway on their website. Also, merchants who have no website can take advantage of Paychant’s e-commerce platform to set up their online shopping store.

Merchants can easily create a custom page to accept crypto payment for services and subscriptions.



Paychant has also developed a Point-of-Sale (PoS) application that supports BTC and ETH payment, this lets merchants accept direct crypto payments from their mobile phones. The application is available on Apple’s App Store and Google’s Playstore.

Paychant also comes with a free fundraising platform that allows individuals or charitable organizations to raise donations in Bitcoin and other crypto-assets.
