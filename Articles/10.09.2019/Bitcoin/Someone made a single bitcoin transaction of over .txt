I would say 94,504 bitcoins is real folding money, buy you can't fold bitcoins. In any case, someone moved $1,018,147,900 worth of bitcoin between wallets and no one knows for sure who it was. The Token Analyst tweeted, "We took a look and saw that a large percentage of it could be traced to @HuobiGlobal addresses."

Huobi Global is a Singapore based cryptocurrency exchange.

$1 Billion+ $BTC was transferred in one transaction yesterday. Where did that come from? ?
