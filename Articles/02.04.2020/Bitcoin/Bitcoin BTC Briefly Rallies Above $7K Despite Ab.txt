Global markets rallied on Thursday after US jobless claims numbers were published, showing an increase of 6,648,000 unemployed Americans over the past week.

This number comes after last week’s report showed that 3.3 million Americans out of work have filed jobless claims.

Despite the overly negative economic landscape, assets across the board rallied on Thursday, including equities, commodities including oil and cryptocurrencies. For a brief period this afternoon, Bitcoin (BTC) managed to surge above $7,000 and trade as high as $7,300 before pulling back to the $6,800 range, where it’s currently trading.

Overall, the crypto market is now up around 2.9% on the day to $191.3 billion, outpacing the S&P 500 and Dow’s 2.2% gain on the day.
