[ad_1]



The ripple rises steadily against the US dollar from the USD 0.1680 support area. The XRP price should rise 3-4%, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The ripple price is slowly bullish above the $ 0.1720 level against the US dollar.

The bulls are likely to seek an upward trend above the resistance levels of $ 0.1780 and $ 0.1800.

An important bearish trendline is forming on the hourly chart of the XRP / USD pair (Kraken data source) with resistance close to $ 0.1760.

The pair may lose a few points, but remains well supported near the $ 0.1720 level.

Ripple Price could recover soon

There has been a strong upward move recently on Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the ripple didn't follow in a similar way. The XRP price was as low as $ 0.1680 and again rose above the simple 100-hour moving average.

There was a steady rise above the $ 0.1720 resistance level. The bulls outperformed the 50% fib retracement level of the recent decline from the high of $ 0.1784 to the low of $ 0.1680.

However, the price is still well below the weekly resistance range of $ 0.1780. There is also an important bearish trendline with resistance near $ 0.1760 an hour diagram of the XRP / USD pair.

Ripple is currently testing trendline resistance at $ 0.1760. Fib retracement levels of 76.4% from the recent drop from the high of $ 0.1784 to the low of $ 0.1680 are also a hurdle.

If there is a significant break above trendline resistance, the bulls will likely make another attempt to clear the $ 0.1780 resistance area. If they are successful, the XRP price will likely rise above the $ 0.1880 and $ 0.1920 levels. The next big resistance is near the $ 0.2000 level.

Downward correction?

If the ripple does not rise above the $ 0.1780 resistance again, it can correct lower. Initial support is near the $ 0.1720 level and the simple 100-hour moving average.

A bearish pause, supported by $ 0.1720 and the 100-hour SMA, could push the price below $ 0.1700. The next major support is near the $ 0.1680 level, below which the bears are expected to test the $ 0.1620 support area in the near future.
