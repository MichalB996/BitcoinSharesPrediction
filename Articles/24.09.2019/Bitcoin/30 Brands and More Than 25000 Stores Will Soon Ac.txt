A burst of support for Bitcoin’s mainstream use as a currency is reportedly coming to France.

Thirty brands and more than 25,000 stores will accept BTC in the first quarter of 2020.

Here’s a look at some of the big-name brands on board.

According to the French media outlet Le Figaro, the adoption is coming via a partnership between crypto payment provider East2PlayPayment, EasyWallet and Global POS.

Once a user pays for an item in BTC, the funds are immediately converted to euros and sent to the merchant.

The CEO of Global POS, Stephane Djiane, says Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency the company plans to support.

“Initially, the service we offer will only allow the use of Bitcoins. Our goal is to open our solution to other crypto-currencies in the future.”

Co-founder of the pet food brand Mustaches says the move will make it much easier for brands to accept crypto assets.

“The acceptance of cryptocurrencies is a real challenge for the brands, [and] we are aware of the expectations of the public and the reach of the message we send to a whole community. “

Early this year, tobacco shops across France reportedly began selling Bitcoin, XRP, Ethereum, Litecoin and Dash.

The crypto startup Digycode partnered with Paris-based payments giant Ingenico to essentially sell crypto IOUs that allow buyers to redeem their crypto via Digycode’s website.
