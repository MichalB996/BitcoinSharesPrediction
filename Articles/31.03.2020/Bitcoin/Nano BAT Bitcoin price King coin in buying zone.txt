The altcoin market has been largely correlated to the price of Bitcoin [BTC], especially after the 12 March market crash and the king coin’s resurgent hold on the crypto-market. However, as Bitcoin’s price moved up, not all the altcoins shared the market sentiment and moved up.

Bitcoin [BTC]

The price of Bitcoin suggested some positive movement in the market, immediately after its massive fall. While it has been climbing upwards, the volume appeared to be less. The price of Bitcoin marked its immediate resistance at $6.8k as it lingered around the $6.4k level, at the time of writing. The support for the coin was also recorded immediately at $5.6k.

Bitcoin, in 2020, has recorded losses worth 8.39%, with the king coin preparing for its halving too. According to the Chaikin Money Flow Indicator, the coin has entered the buying territory.

Due to the recent re-adjustment in mining difficulty, the hash rate fell, following which, more miners might come back to the network.
