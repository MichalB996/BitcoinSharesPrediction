Individual Bitcoin, Ethereum and cryptocurrency holders looking for a way to protect their holdings now have the option to secure an automatic policy offering up to $1 million in the event of catastrophic losses.

Coincover, a UK-based risk management provider, is offering a new policy through Lloyd’s of London for Civic wallet users. Users who sign up for Civic’s digital wallet will automatically be opted-in to the policy.

According to Coincover, the offering will provide protection for Civic’s hot wallet. Hot wallets are typically used to settle cryptocurrency transactions including trades, purchases and remittance payments.

By staying connected to the internet, they remain exposed to potential hackers, unlike cold storage solutions that protect long-term crypto holdings offline.

Coincover guarantees coverage of up to $1 million per wallet against catastrophic losses.

“In the event that a business with Coincover Deposit Protection Guarantee ceases operations due to business failure, catastrophic systems failure or catastrophic data loss that results in its customers being permanently unable to access funds in their wallets, the Deposit Guarantee scheme will access and recover funds on their customers behalf.”
