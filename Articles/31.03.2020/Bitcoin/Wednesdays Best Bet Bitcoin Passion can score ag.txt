#2 BITCOIN PASSION (9-2) was the 2-1 favorite in his course/distance debut Jan. 19, and he rolled home from off the pace that day (runner-up next-out winner). Christophe Clement is 11-for-26 at Tampa Bay, and the promising son of American Pharoah might be able to rally and score again under Antonio Gallardo.

#7 Me and Mr. C (5-1) showed early-pressing speed and hit the board in a pair of local flat mile turf races vs. this kind earlier in the meet. He was an even sixth in the Columbia Stakes last time, and can move forward in his second start after a layoff.

#6 Our Country (2-1) makes his first start since an off the board finish in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf last fall. He showed some ability as a 2-year-old in New York and should be girding away in the stretch.
