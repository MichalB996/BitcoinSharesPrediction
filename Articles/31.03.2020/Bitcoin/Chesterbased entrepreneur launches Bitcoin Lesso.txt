Bitcoin Lessons, a fintech-focused learning app, has officially launched to help educate the public about the history of money and the world of Bitcoin.

Chester-based Gareth Stephens, Founder of Bitcoin Lessons, has spent the past 13 years building products for global software companies including GBG, where he was Head of Product as it progressed beyond a $1 billion dollar valuation.

The free app, available on both iOS and Android, offers a mobile-based bite-sized learning approach similar to popular language app Duolingo.

The free version of the app offers four lessons and users can also choose to pay to unlock all content and earn Bitcoin as they learn. By acting as an incentive to help people complete their learning, they are rewarded their own Bitcoin as they finish each lesson.
