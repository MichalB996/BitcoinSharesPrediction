The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 regained some ground upon opening on the last day of the quarter. Investors gear up for sluggish quarter-end results; however, the green opening on a fifth consecutive day is a ray of light.

Letâ€™s look at where the markets stand right now:

Indices:

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is up by 0.3% and is at 22,394.44 points, which is a 66.96 point increase over its previous close.

S&P 500 index is up by 0.34% and is at 2,635.70 points.

The NASDAQ Composite Index is up by 1.23%.

Stocks:

Apple Inc. (AAPL) is trading at $262.12, thus gaining a 2.86% over its previous close.

Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is trading at $33.43, which is a 12.29% increase.

Commodities:

Brent Crude is trading at $ 25.90.

Gold is trading at $1607.50, a 0.83% decrease.

Despite modest opening, the US stock markets are looking at one of the worst quarterly declines in History. According to analysts, S&P 500 and Dow Jones are already witnessing a phase of recession. However, experts at Goldman Sachs believe that the rise from this phase of recession would be one of the fastest.
