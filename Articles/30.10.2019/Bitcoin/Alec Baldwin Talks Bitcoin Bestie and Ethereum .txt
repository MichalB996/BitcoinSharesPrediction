U.S. users can now automatically copy trades made by eToro’s top investors

eToro, the global trading platform, announced the launch of its CopyTrader™ in the US, which allows traders to set their account to automatically copy all the trades of top-performing crypto asset investors on the eToro platform.

eToro users can access the Copy Traders tab in the app to select from a suite of Popular Investors available for copying. The pool of eligible traders includes crypto influencers like Nicholas Merten, the host of the DataDash YouTube channel, and #11 Ranked Welterweight UFC fighter Ben Askren. With over one million combined followers, these partners were specifically chosen to be copied by the eToro community for their role in growing and promoting the crypto ecosystem.

CopyTrader democratizes investment portfolio management for investors of all kinds. Trades are executed at the same price in real-time and in proportional amounts, enabling any eToro user to execute the same trading strategies of proven crypto investors. Users retain full control of their accounts and can stop copying a trader altogether at any time.

This new tool for retail investors is accompanied by a star-studded marketing campaign. To announce the launch of CopyTrader in the U.S., eToro partnered with Alec Baldwin on a series of ad spots to promote the feature. This intersection between crypto and Hollywood is a notable continuation of mainstream adoption of crypto.
