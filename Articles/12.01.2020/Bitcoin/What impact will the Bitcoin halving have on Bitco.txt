TITLE: What impact will the Bitcoin halving have on Bitcoin mining?

Bitcoin mining has long ceased to be profitable for the majority of hobbyist miners. So when the upcoming halving in May 2020 slashes the block reward in half, will that spell the end even for medium and large-sized producers?

Many people in the space see the halving as a catapult for BTC price and believe it to be extremely bullish.

195 days until the next Bitcoin halving. Less than 3 million Bitcoin left to mine. Hash rate keeps hitting all-time highs. We are watching the strongest computer network in the world continue to get stronger and stronger. Incredible. — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) November 1, 2019





But what effect will it have on the miners? Coin Rivet gathered the opinions of industry experts to get their take on the future of Bitcoin mining after the halving and beyond.

What is the Bitcoin halving?

If at this point you’re wondering what the Bitcoin halving is, here’s a quick recap. Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto programmed the network so that block rewards for miners would be halved every four years.

The first block reward started out at 50 BTC. This was halved in 2012 and again in 2016. The current block reward for miners is therefore 12.5 BTC.

In May, that will go down to 6.25 BTC, and will then half again in another four years’ time (and so on). Here’s a simple explainer video in case you want further details:

Since the Bitcoin network relies heavily on miners to release new Bitcoins into existence, they are incentivised with block rewards. But clearly, as Learnbonds.com chief editor Edith Muthoni points out: “As block rewards continue to diminish, so do miners’ rewards.”

She continues: “This brings us into a seeming conundrum: if miners will no longer receive block rewards (or too little), will they continue mining? What will be their motivation to stay on? What does this mean for the network and Bitcoin?”

The halving’s effect on Bitcoin mining

In the short term at least, it seems as if the halving will have a negative effect on Bitcoin mining. Global CEO of the RRMine Bitcoin cloud mining platform Steve Tsou says in unequivocal terms:

“The halving in 2020 will have great impacts on Bitcoin miners: 1) Miners with low mining efficiency will be forced to pause and re-evaluate their business operations. 2) Digital mining is becoming the racetrack for giant international companies because they have more advanced machines and cheaper sources of electricity.”

Ramak J Sedigh, founder and CEO of Plouton Mining, echoes Tsou’s sentiment, saying: “The upcoming halving will force the small operators and those running S9s out of the market, except in the unlikely scenario that BTC reaches a new all-time high by the end of May.

“The bottom line is, you’re out if you’re not able to upgrade both your infrastructure to the 2500W miner and equipment to the 70+ TH/s or upcoming 5 and 3 NM miners with even higher TH/s.”

Co-founder and CEO of the RockX digital asset services platform Alex Lam agrees. As one of China’s most prolific miners and one of the first to use ASIC miners, Lam previously founded RockMiner, one of the most influential cryptocurrency mining companies in the world.

He says: “The next Bitcoin halving is likely to result in mining profitability decreasing significantly in the short term.”

Bitcoin’s price at the time of the halving

While the general consensus is that the Bitcoin halving will reduce miners’ profitability (at least for the short term), there is still a possibility this won’t happen. But that all depends on the price of BTC at the time of the halving.

Digital marketing officer at peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace Paxful Jeffrey Barroga says: “It all boils down to the price of Bitcoin after the halving.”

He explains: “If there’s no significant increase, Bitcoin mining may no longer be sustainable unless you’re a major mining centre.

“Mining is already competitive and resource-extensive as it is, and when you combine that with the impending block reward reduction in May, hobbyist miners and small players might find that whatever BTC they gain is insufficient to pay for the overhead costs of running their rigs.
