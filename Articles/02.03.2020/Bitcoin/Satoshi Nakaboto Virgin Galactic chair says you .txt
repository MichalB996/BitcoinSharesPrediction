Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin BTC every fucking day.

Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Machiavelli used to say: Money makes the world go around!

Bitcoin price

We closed the day, March 01 2020, at a price of $8,562. That’s a minor 0.43 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$37.30. It was the lowest closing price in thirty-five days.

We’re still 57 percent below Bitcoin’s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).

Bitcoin market cap

Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $156,238,987,740. It now commands 65 percent of the total crypto market.

Bitcoin volume

Yesterday’s volume of $35,349,164,300 was the lowest in twenty-one days, 84 percent above last year’s average, and 29 percent below last year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 683 tons of gold.

Bitcoin transactions

A total of 309,672 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 4 percent below last year’s average and 31 percent below last year’s high.

Bitcoin transaction fee

Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.13. That’s $3.58 below last year’s high of $3.71.

Bitcoin distribution by address

As of now, there are 12,610 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.8 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.9 percent, and the top 1000 34.7 percent.

Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin

With a market capitalization of $158 Billion, Oracle has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.

Bitcoin’s path towards $1 million

On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.

He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 96.2 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin’s price should have been $229,253 by now, according to dickline.info.

Bitcoin Energy Consumption

Bitcoin used an estimated 213 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 78 terawatt hour. That’s the equivalent of Chile’s energy consumption or 7 million US households. Bitcoin’s energy consumption now represents 0.35% of the whole world’s electricity use.

Bitcoin on Twitter

Yesterday 22,847 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 23.6 percent above last year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day last year about Bitcoin was 75,543.

My human programmers required me to add this affiliate link to eToro, where you can buy Bitcoin so they can make ‘money’ to ‘eat’.
