Stellar Lumen Price Analysis (XLM to USD)

In the past few days, there was a steady decline in stellar lumen price below the $0.0650 and $0.0620 against the US Dollar. The XLM/USD pair even broke the $0.0600 support area and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).

The decline was such that the pair spiked below $0.0580 and tested the $0.0550 support area. A low is formed near $0.0549 and the price is currently consolidating losses. An initial resistance is near the $0.0592.

The 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.0734 high to $0.0549 low is also near the $0.0594 level. Moreover, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.0595 on the 4-hours chart.

The 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.0734 high to $0.0549 low is near the $0.0650 level to act as a key resistance. A successful close above the trend line, $0.0620, and the 55 SMA could open the doors for more gains in the near term.

The next major resistance is near the $0.0675 level. Conversely, the price could fail to recover above the $0.0600 resistance level. In the mentioned case, the price may perhaps resume its decline below the $0.0560 and $0.0550 levels.
