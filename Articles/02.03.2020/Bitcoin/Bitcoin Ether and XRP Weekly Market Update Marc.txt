BTC/USD

Bitcoin registered one of its best sessions in the last few days and moved up to $9,968 on Sunday, February 23 adding 3 percent to its value.

The new week, however, started with a large selloff in traditional markets, which did not spare digital assets. The BTC/USD pair was rejected hard at $10,000 and erased 3.2 percent before stopping at $9,652.

24-hour trading volumes slightly increased from around $32 billion during the weekend to $38-$40 billion on Monday and Tuesday as more and more positions were liquidated. This, combined with the persisting bear pressure resulted in a sharp drop to $9,298 on Tuesday, February 25. The leading cryptocurrency broke below the $9,500 support zone (Fibonacci 23.60 level) for the first time since February 5.

The mid-week session on Wednesday was no different and BTC formed its third consecutive red candle on the daily chart. It fell below the 50-day EMA and lost another 5.6 percent of the price while breaking the next obvious support zone – $9,150 – $9,000, also near Feb 38.20. The most popular cryptocurrency stopped at $8,775 and found support at the 200-day EMA.

On Thursday, February 27 bitcoin was again highly volatile. It was moving in the $8,975 – $8,531 zone and ended the day with a small gain to $8,813.

The coin continued to slide on the last day of the workweek and fell down to $8,693. Bears manage to push price all the way down to $8,400 during intraday, but the level, in combination with the mid-term uptrend line provided the necessary support.

On the first day of the weekend, the BTC/USD pair made one step back and registered yet another losing session, this time closing at $8,517. It was 9.4 percent down for the month of February.

On Sunday, March 1, the price of BTC remained unchanged after bears made another attempt to break the $8,400 line.

ETH/USD

The Ethereum Project token ETH climbed up to $275 on Sunday, February 23 and bulls were getting ready to test the important resistance line.

On Tuesday, February 25, the ETH/USD pair continued to slide and reached $246 while losing 7 percent of its value. It broke below the $250 support and did not stop in front of the Fibonacci 23.60 line at $247.

The ether nosedived to $221 in the first half of the day on Wednesday smashing through both the $230-$225 support area and Fibonacci 38.20 level at $222 to reach $214. The $222 mark was a long-standing support/resistance in the last few months. The coin managed to recover some of the losses in the late hours of trading and ended the day at $223, above the already-mentioned line.

The fourth session of the week was somehow positive for bulls as their favorite coin took a break and climbed up to $239 during intraday, closing the day with a small gain to $227.
