TITLE: Bitcoin Tech Analysis – Recap and Mid-Morning Review – 08/09/19
URL:   https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-tech-analysis-recap-mid-080633250.html

Bitcoin found much-needed support on Saturday, bringing to an end a run of 3 consecutive days in the red.

Rising by 1.73% on Saturday, Bitcoin partially reversed a 2.59% slide from Friday, to end the day at $10,489.

A relatively bullish day saw Bitcoin rise from a start of a day intraday low $10,306 to a late afternoon intraday high $10,582.

Moving through relatively tight ranges, Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested.

Through the latter part of the day, resistance at $10,500 limited Bitcoin’s upside on the day. Bitcoin’s failure to break out from $10,500 left Bitcoin at sub-$10,500 levels at the day end.

In spite of seeing red for 3 consecutive days ahead of the weekend, it’s been a bullish start to the month, with Bitcoin was up by 9.06% to the end of Saturday. Outgunning all but Monero’s XMR from the top 10, Bitcoin’s dominance held onto 70% levels.

For the bulls, the extended bullish trend, formed at 15th December’s swing lo $3,215.2, remained firmly intact. Early September’s break back through the 38.2% FIB of $9,734 and continued to hold well above the 60.2% FIB of $7,245 reaffirmed the bullish trend.

This Morning

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.73% to $10,565.2. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin move from an early morning low $10,490 to mid-morning high $10,599 before easing back.

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested, with resistance at $10,600 pinning Bitcoin back early on.

For the Day Ahead

A move back through the morning high $10,599 to $10,600 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $10,612 into play.

Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $10,599.

Barring an extended broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin would likely come up short of the second major resistance level at $10,735.

In the event of a breakout, Bitcoin could revisit Friday’s day high $10,933 before any pullback.

Failure to move back through the morning low could pressure Bitcoin later in the day.

A fall back through the morning low $10,490 to $10,450 levels would bring the first major support level at $10,336 into play.

Barring a broad-based crypto reversal, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,300 levels and Friday’s low $10,208.
