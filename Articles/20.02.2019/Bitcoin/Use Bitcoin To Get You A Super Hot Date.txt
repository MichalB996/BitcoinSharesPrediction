Are you sure you are aware of all the thing you need to get a hot date apart from your mood too? No, you probably need lesser than you think. And hopefully, you do not need to win bitcoins to get you a date, because that would be absurd and that is the kind of date that we are not into. But, knowing this shit can turn you into a super date legend and that is something we want for you and you should want for yourself. So, to get started know for sure if you want you a sexy date that makes you forget all the nasty things that go on in everyday life or are you okay with the mediocre and you would rather stick to the casual love flings that are more exhausting than anything else ever!

Bitcoin is ten years old! Yay! Where is the cake at bitcoin lovers? And on its tenth, we thought it should be a good idea to brag a little and use our bitcoin loving power to get us some love. Here’s how:

Understand the basics:

Bitcoin is a mood. It is a frame of mind. Do you know what it does? Do you know how it does it? Can you draw the links? Good. Then you can have all the fun, just remember that people have hated it for it being better than money and people have failed to love it because it is the new hip thing in town that not everyone can have or dream of.

Use the basics:

The sexy mood that bitcoin knowing knowledge puts you in, about how passionate inventions have changed humanity and how humanity hates to change itself for its own better is how you will get your date swag on. You need to show off your world caring, but not peasantry ideas, you love the idea of doing boujee things and bitcoin is your go to, this mood can unleash all the right vibes without sounding like some pervert talking about their money on the first date.

Flaunt yourself:

Your passions tell a lot about you, a lot more than your words or actions could and this means that if you want your date to stick to the end of the night for the dessert, or coffee, whatever you’re calling it, you need to keep them hooked by leaving a mystery of the critical but potentially lovable, complex but mixed signal kinda person and your bitcoin reinforcement will do just that.

Try it out and get lucky! Goodluck Fabio!
