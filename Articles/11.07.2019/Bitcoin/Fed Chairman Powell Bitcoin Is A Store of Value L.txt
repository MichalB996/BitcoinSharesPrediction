Bitcoin Politics Fed Chairman Powell: Bitcoin Is A Store of Value Like Gold

Cryptocurrencies took the center stage again during Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs second day of testimony before the U.S. Senate. Today, lawmakers expressed their concerns about the threat that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies pose to the financial system, including the possible challenge of bitcoin replacing the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency.

Powell: The U.S. Should Not Assume That The Dollar‚Äôs Status As A Reserve Currency Would Last Forever

During the second day of Jerome Powell‚Äôs testimony, senators reiterated their concern about private corporations, such as Facebook, who with their money and power are now attempting to create their own currency and monetary policy.

Lawmakers also worried that the U.S. was lagging behind other nations on real-time payment methods.

In this connection, Powell indicated that he had not seen bitcoin used as a payment method.

However, he noted, bitcoin is already increasingly taking over gold in the global economy as a store of value.

Lawmakers also mentioned their uneasiness regarding bitcoin‚Äôs possible long-term challenge to replace the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency.

Powell admitted that this was in the realm of possibility, albeit only in the long term. He also emphasized that the U.S. should not assume that the dollar‚Äôs status as a reserve currency would last forever.

Powell also said that having the dollar as the world reserve currency conveyed both benefits and costs. And he asserted that to replace the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency, the issuing country would be required to have the rule of law and a highly developed financial system.

Regarding Powell‚Äôs position on the need for a global reserve currency, Peter Schiff hastened to point out,

‚ÄúPowell is wrong. The world does not need another reserve currency to replace the dollar. Gold is a much better reserve asset than any fiat currency. In fact, gold reserves legitimize the currencies they back. The dollar only became the reserve currency due to its gold backing.‚Äù

On July 7, 2019, during Powell‚Äôs Senate testimony on monetary policy, the value of bitcoin dropped below USD 12,000 after Powell flagged ‚Äúserious concerns‚Äù about Facebook‚Äôs planned Libra cryptocurrency. However, bitcoin is already demonstrating its resiliency as it inches back to the USD 12,000 mark.
