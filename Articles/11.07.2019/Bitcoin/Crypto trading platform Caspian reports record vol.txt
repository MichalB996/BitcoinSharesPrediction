Caspian, operating firm of a full-stack crypto trading, portfolio and risk management platform, today announced that it has reached a milestone with its June monthly volume trading figures.

The 18-month-old firm saw trading volumes surge to $1.068 USD billion in June 2019.

Caspian has taken the decision to start publicly releasing its trade volume information on a monthly basis in order to enhance transparency in the institutional crypto market.

“We have seen a significant number of reports in recent weeks detailing fake volume and trading figures. As a company that is focused upon building up the crypto market for institutional-grade investment we felt it was necessary to issue our true and unaltered volumes so the market can now measure real institutional participation.”

– Robert Dykes. Caspian CEO & Co-founder

Caspian’s last quarter has seen trade volumes increase from $578 million in April 2019 to $1.069 billion in June 2019, representing an upswing of 85% in two months.

Trading volumes are now 207% higher than what they were at the end of Q1 2019 in comparison to the end of Q2 2019.

Caspian launched in March 2018 with its full-stack crypto asset management platform tying together the biggest crypto exchanges in a single interface. The platform now provides access to 30 spot exchanges and 7 derivative exchanges, along with a complete suite of sophisticated trading algorithms, real-time and historical P&L and exposure tracking and professional customer service.
