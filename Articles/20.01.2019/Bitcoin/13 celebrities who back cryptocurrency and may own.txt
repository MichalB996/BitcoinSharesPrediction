There's no shortage of public figures who have advocated crypto as the currency of the future.

From artists like Pitbull and Snoop Dogg to actors Johnny Depp and Ashton Kutcher, recent years have seen a surge in the number of celebrities to get involved with cryptocurrencies.

Some of them could be in possession of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.

Up until relatively recently, cryptocurrency hadn't captured the interest of the general public; it was reserved almost exclusively for the engineers, developers, and entrepreneurs who had been involved in its conception around a decade ago.

However, the bitcoin bubble in 2017 caused cryptocurrencies to soar in value, and led to millions purchasing cryptoshares and even setting up their own mining farms.

Despite the considerable drop in the value of bitcoin over the past year, experts are predicting a new cryptocurrency boom in the near future, possibly from 2020.
