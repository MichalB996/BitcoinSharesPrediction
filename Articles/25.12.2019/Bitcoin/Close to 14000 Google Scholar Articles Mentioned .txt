Academia Loves Bitcoin

On Halloween 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto dropped the Bitcoin whitepaper on the internet and it’s likely he didn’t know how massive his invention would become. After publishing the paper on the Cryptography Mailing List, two months later he launched the network. The technology slowly started gathering traction on the internet and people would hear about it in passing in forums and social media. In 2009, almost immediately after the Bitcoin network’s launch, analysts, teachers, students, and economists took notice of the fascinating protocol called Bitcoin. So scholars began to research the subject regularly creating systematic work and papers in order to increase knowledge of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency solutions. In 2009, there were roughly 83 Google Scholar articles that mentioned Bitcoin and in 2010 the number jumped to 136 academic reports.

Studies involving the subject of cryptocurrency continued to create a great stock of knowledge. Digital currency papers that were published helped establish standards and confirm facts, alongside reaffirming the results of network testing. Moreover, studious researchers wrote papers in order to solve issues with distributed ledger technology. Cryptocurrency papers and academic journals discussed and supported theorems and hypothetical questions as well. In 2011 through 2013 lots of Google Scholar papers called blockchain technology a waste of resources and described how Bitcoin would never last. While other studies published in the early days also detailed how blockchain and cryptocurrency solutions could revolutionize the world of finance. In 2011, there were 218 academic papers on the Google Scholar platform that mentioned Bitcoin, the number doubled the next year, and in 2013 scholarly articles doubled again with roughly 868 that could be found on the browser’s academic application. Since 2014, when 2,070 scholarly articles were found online, the number of academic papers increased by 561% as there are now more than 13,700 Google Scholar articles on the web.
