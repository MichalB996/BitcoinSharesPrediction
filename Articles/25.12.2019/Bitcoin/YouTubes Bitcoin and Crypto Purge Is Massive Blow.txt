Ran NeuNer, the host of CNBC’s Crypto Trader, is weighing in on the controversy surrounding the recent actions taken by YouTube against cryptocurrency content creators.

Dozens of videos from some of the biggest Bitcoin, altcoin and blockchain creators have been removed in the last 24 hours.

NeuNer tells his 110,000 followers on Twitter,

“YouTube deleting all Crypto content is a MASSIVE blow to the industry. YouTube is the go to place for educational video and the first port of call for new people entering the eco system to learn the basics. As a community we should challenge this formally.”

A number of channels, including Boxmining and Ivan on Tech, are switching their videos to “private” in an attempt to prevent all of their content from being hit by the sudden purge.

Despite the holiday season, YouTube says it’s investigating the cryptocurrency smackdown to try to determine exactly what’s going on. The video-sharing giant hopes to have an update on the situation shortly.

“Jumping in – we’re looking into this. Hope to share an update soon.”

Many creators are taking to Twitter to spread the word, confirming that their BTC, ETH and XRP-related videos have been removed for containing “harmful or dangerous content” or for allegedly containing the “sale of regulated goods.”

Here’s a look at some of the creators who say they’re caught up in the sweep.

Due to the .@YouTube censorship of crypto content, I've put all my videos as "private" for the time being. I'm forced to do this because if the Youtube algorithm tags more public videos, it'll mean the deletion of my channel. pic.twitter.com/TAbX8OPfEO — Boxmining (@boxmining) December 25, 2019

Nice Christmas present from Youtube, 37 videos pulled and a strike. Ouch. #bitcoin #crypto #censorship — The Crypto Lark (@TheCryptoLark) December 24, 2019

YouTube implemented a new terms and conditions policy on December 10th, which contains a line stating that the platform “is under no obligation to host or serve content.”

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, a leader in the crypto space, is opting for more change.

“It may be time the crypto community take a stab at its own blockchain-enabled sensorship-resistent social media platform. Lots of challenges though, spam, scam, trolls, incentives, copyright, token economics, governance, stickiness, privacy… But It’s about time!”
