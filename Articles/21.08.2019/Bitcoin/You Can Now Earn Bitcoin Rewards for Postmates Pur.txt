Lolli has said that about 40 percent of its users are new to the cryptocurrency scene.

Speaking with CoinDesk, Lolli co-founder and CEO Alex Adelman says Lolli remains committed to making bitcoin more mainstream.

“This is another step towards the mainstream adoption of bitcoin as Postmates is used daily by people across the US,” Adelman said. “One of Lolli’s objectives to make bitcoin a part of people’s everyday lives. Our partnership with Postmates achieves this.”

“Everybody eats and now you don’t have to feel guilty about ordering in when you’re stacking sats on each order,” Adelman added.
