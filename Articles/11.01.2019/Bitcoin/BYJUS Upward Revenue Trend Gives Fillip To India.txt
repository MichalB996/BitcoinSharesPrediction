A month back, BYJU’S had given a fillip to India’s edtech industry by achieving a whopping $4 Bn valuation after it raised $540 Mn Series F funding led by South African venture capital firm Naspers, with a significant contribution from Canada’s Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB).

At the time, Inc42 had quoted startup’s founder Byju Raveendran saying that the collaboration with Naspers and CPPIB was sealed for a long-term business.

BYJU’S had announced to utilise the raised funds in introducing more innovative technology solutions to its platform, foray into international edtech markets, personalise its learning experience for the users, including a roll-out of vernacular contents in regional languages such as Gujarati, Marathi and Tamil.

The startup earlier claimed to have crossed the $14.1 Mn (INR 100 Cr) monthly revenue mark in May 2018. At the time, BYJU’S published a statement stating that it has been growing at a 100% CAGR for the last three years since its inception in 2015. The startup further projects its revenue to increase at a 32.6% CAGR, reaching $242 Mn (INR 1,743 Cr) by 2022.
