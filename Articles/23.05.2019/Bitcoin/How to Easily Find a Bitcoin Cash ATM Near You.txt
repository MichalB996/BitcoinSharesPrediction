Put BCH ATMs on Your Radar

There are more than 1,600 ATMs that offer the buying or selling of bitcoin cash (BCH) all around the globe. To find your nearest location, you can check out Coin ATM Radar, a service that lists and maps the cryptocurrency kiosk machines. Besides the website, the platform includes an app for iOS and Android mobile devices so you can find a BCH ATM right on your phone.

If you know of a bitcoin cash kiosk which is not listed on Coin ATM Radar you can submit the location to be added to the service. And if you find out that no such machine exists in your area, you can even go one step further and order one from one of the many cryptocurrency ATM providers that support BCH and go into the business yourself.
