Mr Buffett is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist, who is the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. He is worth almost $90billion (£73billion) and made his enormous fortune buying then selling stocks in some of the biggest companies on the planet. With millions around the world aiming to follow in his footsteps, Mr Buffett revealed his advice on how to achieve such wealth.

His first tip – investing in the long game.

In an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box show, Mr Buffett said: “Now if they think they can dance in and out [of the market] and buy and sell stocks, they ought to head for Las Vegas. I mean, they can’t do that.

“But what they can do is determinate that there’s a number of solid American businesses, a great number of them, and if you own a cross section of them and particularly if you buy them over time, you basically can’t lose.”

He added: “I know what markets are going to do over a long period of time: They’re going to go up.

"But in terms of what’s going to happen in a day or a week or a month or a year even, I’ve never felt that I knew it and I’ve never felt that was important.”
