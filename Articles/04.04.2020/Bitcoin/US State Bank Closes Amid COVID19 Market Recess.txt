In a decision by the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions, the First State Bank of Barboursville, which operated with $152M in net assets, closed yesterday. As of today, its $140M deposits have been acquired by MVB Bank Inc. of Fairmont.

According to an official statement by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the small regional bank has experienced financial problems since 2015:

Today, four departments of the failed bank will be reopened as branches of MVB Bank Inc.
