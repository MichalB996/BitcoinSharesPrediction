The current situation with the cryptocurrency market can simply be described as uncertainty, as neither the bulls nor the bears have control of the situation in the prospective short-term. This is also outlined with the rates for the top 10 coins.

Below is the important data for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum ETH), and XRP:

Name Ticker Market Cap Price Volume (24H) Change (24H) Bitcoin BTC $125,053,904,237 $6,832.02 $35,013,435,664 -1.30% Ethereum ETH $15,821,732,557 $143.34 $12,126,279,216 -0.94% XRP XRP $7,915,295,863 $0.180656 $2,003,476,391 0.27%

BTC/USD

After Bitcoin (BTC) bounced off to $7,200, the significant decline has not occurred. Moreover, the rate of the main cryptocurrency has even gone up over the last 7 days by almost 10%.

On the 4H chart, Bitcoin (BTC) is trying to retest the crucial resistance level at $7,000 for the second time. However, the current rise is going to be a false one because of a recent long bearish candle.

The more likely price forecast that traders might expect is a drop between the $6,400-$6,500 zone, where huge liquidity is concentrated.

At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $6,893.

ETH/USD

Ethereum (ETH) is showing slightly better price dynamics than Bitcoin (BTC); however, the short-term bearish scenario remains relevant. The rate of the chief altcoin has declined by 0.73% since yesterday.

Ethereum (ETH) is trading sideways between the support level at $137 and the resistance level at $147. Based on the trading volume, buyers have no more strength to push the price higher. Furthermore, the Moving Average Congverence/Divergence (MACD) indicator is about to switch to the red, confirming the upcoming bearish sentiments. If this scenario comes true, a decline to the support level at $137 is about to occur shortly.

At press time, Ethereum was trading at $143.31.

XRP/USD

Even though the rate of XRP has even gone up, its price forecast remains bearish. The rate of the coin has risen by 6.65% over the last 7 days.

XRP is located within the Triangle pattern on the 4H chart. From a technical perspective, it is a bearish figure accompanied by the increasing selling trading volume. Currently, there are no reasons for growth, even as a short-term projection. Respectively, the closest scenario is a sharp decline to the nearest support at $0.17. This might happen even by the end of this week.

At press time, XRP was trading at $0.1896.
