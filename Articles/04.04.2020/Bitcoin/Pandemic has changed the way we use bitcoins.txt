The intelligence firm Chainalysis found that the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic instability affected the habits of bitcoin holders. In report describes the change in the trend of using Bitcoin in three areas – for payment for services, gambling and in the darknet markets.

In terms of payment, there is always a strong correlation between the price of bitcoin and the use of a coin: the more bitcoin costs, the more likely it is to be spent paying for something. But after a coronavirus outbreak, this correlation weakened by about half and the total number of bitcoins issued decreased.

Most notable is the change in user behavior in the darknet markets. Since the start of the pandemic, the use of bitcoins on the darknet has declined, which has led to a general decline in criminals’ income. Chainalysis believes that strict controls on the movement of citizens have violated the supply chains of drugs and other illicit substances worldwide. However, Chainalysis notes that with China’s gradual recovery from the crisis, darknet activity is also gradually recovering.

As for gambling, there is now no connection between the price and the use of bitcoin in gambling. According to analysts, this indicates that the pandemic does not significantly affect player behavior.
