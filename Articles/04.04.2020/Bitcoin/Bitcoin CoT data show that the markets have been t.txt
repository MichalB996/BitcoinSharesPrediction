Asset managers increased their long positions by 48 contracts and reduced 49 short positions.

Leveraged funds increase long positions by 353 and reduce 311 short positions.

The price trend at Bitcoin reflects the increasing upward movement of fund managers and leveraged funds as the price has risen quite well. Once the price reached 7K, the market sold quite aggressively. It will be interesting to see the data for the next few weeks to see if the longs rise again after the BTC / USD price hits a wall. Interestingly, the positions of asset managers and leveraged funds continue to speak for the short side. This means that the longs still have a lot of catching up to do.
