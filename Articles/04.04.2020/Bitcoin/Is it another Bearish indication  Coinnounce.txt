Bitcoin crossed the $7,200 mark on Thursday. It was a much-needed break from the consolidation phase for all the Bitcoin enthusiasts. However, since then, the BTCUSD has been trading around the $6,700 range. It hasn’t been able to push past the $7,000 barrier even once after that.

The fact that trading volumes are pretty low has added to the distrust of the investors. Some analysts and self-proclaimed Bitcoin experts are pointing that this could be the calm before the storm. Bitcoin could drop to par $4,000 levels soon. And they might just be right!

Let us take a closer look at the BTCUSD technicals to understand better:

If we bring up the daily chart, it can be observed that Thursday’s rally is a candle with a small body and a large wick. This indicates that there wasn’t a substantial Bullish momentum at play.

support at $6,650 . BTCUSD reached the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement point. It has formed strong

As of now, BTCUSD is trading at $6725. Pivot is at $6518.26.

Relative Strength Index has a neutral view.

The path ahead for the BTCUSD

On pulling up the weekly chart, and extending it to view the historical prices, we would be able to backtest the prices.

It can be observed that the trend for the Bitcoin has been a consolidation around the $6,800 – $7,200 range .

This region could potentially work as a resistance.

If Bitcoin breaks out of this region, and that too with large traded volumes, the BTCUSD could potentially reach the $9,000 level.

Bitcoin prices would be closely associated with how the COVID-19 pandemic is being fought off by various countries of the world. As of now, it might be too early to associate a Bullish signal with Bitcoin.

However, it has a possibility of crossing the $9,000 level mark, if the consolidation is broken with high volumes. Until then, it would be advisable to tread with caution.
