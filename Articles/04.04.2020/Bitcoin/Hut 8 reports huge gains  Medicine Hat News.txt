Hut 8 Cryptocurrency is reporting a huge gain in revenue and a 50 per cent increase in profit over the past year, thanks mostly to increased operations at its Medicine Hat data-processing facility.

The company’s year-end financial statements, made public on Friday, show profits rose by $12 million in 2019 despite what the company described as volatile prices for Bitcoin, which it earns for handling transactions of the well-known cryptocurrency.

Operating income ($5 million) and net income ($2 million) also pushed into positive territory compared to 2018, which included startup costs for the major Medicine Hat centre and a massive write-down of the value of Bitcoin held by the company.

“2019 was a milestone year as we achieved bottom line profitability which allowed for growth and paying down debt,” said chief financial officer Jimmy Vaiopoulos in a release.

Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the company responded to steep decline in Bitcoin prices by reconfiguring operating to reduce power draw in a massive supply contract with the City of Medicine Hat. It stated last month that power use had dropped by half, but only resulted in a 35 per cent loss in production.
