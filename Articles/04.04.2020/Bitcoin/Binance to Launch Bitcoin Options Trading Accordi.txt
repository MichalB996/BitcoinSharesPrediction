Binance may launch a Bitcoin Options trading expansion to its platform, according to a tweet from the exchange’s CEO himself, Changpeng Zhao.

Of course, his tweet was in reply to a Binance tweet asking if users notice anything new in a recent test flight of the platform’s mobile application.

Bitcoin options trading is a feature that many traders have been waiting for for some time. While the service is available on other platforms, like Deribit or FTX, it isn’t on something like Binance, the biggest exchange in the world in terms of market cap.

Should they actually launch such a service, users all over the world will pour into Binance’s options offering. In fact, this would bring even more legitimacy to the cryptocurrency space, ensuring a more streamlined expansion towards mainstream audiences.

Plus, more services for traders is never a bad thing.

Recently, Binance has been in the news for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the platform has recently acquired the coin post aggregator, CoinMarketCap. From there, Binance also revealed that it would launch a cryptocurrency mining pool – something many of its competitors simply do not have. That is set to launch in quarter two of this year, and will likely do so in some sort of beta format at first.
