Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market has seen a shift to the green side of life as Bitcoin has broken through the $4000 mark once more.

Taking data from Coin360.com, it’s clear that the market is facing an overall positive end to the week with Bitcoin and the leading altcoins showing increases in market cap and prices.

Bitcoin has been hovering around figures of $3800 and $3900 but hasn’t topped $4000 since last month until now.

The positive increase has affected Ethereum which, at the time of writing, is boasting 6.2% increases in pricing.

Ripple’s XRP has also gained on the positive trend with a 2.25% increase and the market cap has overtaken the price increase.

Litecoin, which one held a lower ranking than Bitcoin Cash, has overtaken to take the fourth positioned cryptocurrency in terms of market cap. At the time of writing, LTC has seen an 8.14% increase and is showing no signs of slowing down its increasing price.

This time 24 hours ago, eToro’s Mati Greenspan pointed out that altseason is “zooming” with the markets prices shooting up.

If the weekend can maintain the positive trajectory in price, this time next week, we could be looking at a very different market.
