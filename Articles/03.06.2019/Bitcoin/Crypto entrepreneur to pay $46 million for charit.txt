A cryptocurrency entrepreneur will pay millions to have lunch with one of the most notable bitcoin skeptics out there: Warren Buffett.

Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency TRON and CEO of file-sharing company BitTorrent, had the winning bid at $4.57 million. In an open letter posted on Medium, Sun said he would invite other blockchain industry leaders to dine with the legendary value investor in New York.

When asked for comment, Buffett laughed out loud and told CNBC's Becky Quick he was looking forward to the lunch.

Sun said in the letter that he was "a long-term believer (and certainly a big fan) of Buffett and his long-term value investing strategy," adding that "the long-term value investment strategy and cryptocurrency, in my eyes, are one in the same."

Based on his comments since 2013, Buffett would probably disagree with that characterization of cryptocurrency. The Berkshire Hathaway CEO has labeled the world's first and largest digital currency everything from "rat poison squared" to a "delusion" that "attracts charlatans." Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger has called it a "turd," and said at the annual shareholder meeting that trading cryptocurrencies is "just dementia."

They are in good company â€” Jamie Dimon and Bill Gates, economists Nouriel Roubini and Robert Shiller, and the fund managers Ray Dalio and Howard Marks have all questioned bitcoin's legitimacy. Buffett and others have been less critical of bitcoin's underlying technology blockchain, which has use cases aside from cryptocurrencies.
