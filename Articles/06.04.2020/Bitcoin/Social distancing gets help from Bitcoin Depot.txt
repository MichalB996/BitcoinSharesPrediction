Despite a constant barrage of media telling people across the country to practice social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic, there are those people who still won't comply.

To do its part, Bitcoin Depot, a major ATM operator, decided to take matters into its own hands and temporarily shut off its crypto ATMs in high-traffic areas to limit the spread of the virus.

Bitcoin Depot operates more than 600 Bitcoin ATMs, known as BTMs, across 25 states in the U.S.

By shutting off its BTMs in high traffic areas, the management at Bitcoin Depot hopes other ATM operators will soon follow the company’s lead and shut off its own machines in areas where people tend to congregate, such as malls, a company spokesperson recently toldCoinTelegraph.Due to the many touchpoints of cash and the BTM touch screens, the company has also assigned a special team of field technicians to disinfect and clean the machines.

"We are continuing to monitor for locations that inhibit our users from socially distancing themselves from others," Alona Lubovnaya, Bitcoin Depot’s director of product said. "We estimate 10% of our machines will be in temporary lockdown until the end of April, or until further notice."
