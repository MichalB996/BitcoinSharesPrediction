Crypto exchange Gemini is adding support for Brave browser’s BAT token later this month.

Announcing the news on Monday, Gemini said users will be able to deposit BAT into their accounts beginning on April 24. Trading support for the token would be added "soon" thereafter.



Once listed, BAT would be the sixth digital asset available for trading on Gemini, joining bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC) and Zcash.

"We will be offering USD, BTC, and ETH trading pairs for BAT on both our continuous order book and our automated block trading system," said Gemini.

A representative later told The Block in an email: "At Gemini, we’re always looking at interesting crypto products that move the industry forward. The Basic Attention Token (BAT) has a proven market and its novel usage suggests that demand will continue to grow as the ecosystem evolves."

Notably, users will have to create a new Ethereum deposit address for depositing BAT tokens as existing Gemini Ethereum addresses are not supported, per the announcement.



Just last month, Brave added 1 million new users amid the coronavirus pandemic. That number brings the browser's monthly active users (MAU) to 13.5 million and daily active users (DAU) to 4.3 million as of March 2020.
