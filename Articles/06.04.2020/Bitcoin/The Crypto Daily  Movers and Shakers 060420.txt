This Morning

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

Elsewhere, it was a bullish start to the day, with Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Cash SV rallying by 1.74% and by 1.58% to lead the way.

For the Bitcoin Day Ahead

Bitcoin would need to move back through the morning high $6,888.0 to bring the first major resistance level at $6,902.00 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break back through to $6,900 levels

Barring another crypto rally, the first major resistance level at $6,902 and Sunday’s high $6,917.9 would likely pin Bitcoin back on the day.

Failure to move back through the morning high could see Bitcoin hit reverse.

A fall back through to sub-$6,800 levels would bring the first major support level at $6,674.30 into play.

Barring an extended crypto sell-off, however, Bitcoin should steer of the second major support level at $6,568.40.
