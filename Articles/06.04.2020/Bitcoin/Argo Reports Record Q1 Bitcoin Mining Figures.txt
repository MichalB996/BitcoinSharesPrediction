The numbers also took a hit with the recent drop in the prices of Bitcoin due to the concerns related to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Mentioning the impressive figures, Peter Wall, chief executive officer at Argo, said: “Despite challenging conditions the company continues to deliver some of the best mining margins in the industry. This reflects Argo’s high-quality mining infrastructure and expertise.”

The release also outlined that the total revenue for the company in the first quarter of this year stood at £6 million (around $7.67 million) based on average currency rates for the period.

Meanwhile, the London-based company also detailed that it procured 1,000 Bitmain Antminer S17+ machines, which are going to be operational by the end of April. With the installation of the new devices, Argo’s Bitcoin mining capacity will be increased by 10 percent, generating around 730 PH.
