Over on Twitter, here were the top tweets about Bitcoin:

From theRealKiyosaki :

WHY IS DOLLAR DYING? 2008 Fed printed $4.5 Trillion to save rich. 2020 Fed will have to print $6-8 Trillion, maybe more to save US economy. There is only $9.5 Trillion in gold in WHOLE WORLD. Buy real gold silver Bitcoin. No paper ETF gold or silver. PhDs at Fed are IDIOTS.

: From ZubyMusic :

The same people who think bitcoin is ‘dead’ at $6,000 will want to buy it when it reaches $20,000 again…Because humans beings are not rational.

: From Bitcoin:

Bitcoin went from $0 to $20k with no central bank, market makers, or buy-in from institutions. Just HODLers. Unwavering hands.

Unstoppable belief.
